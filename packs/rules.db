A creature that touches contact poison with exposed skin suffers its effects.</p>\n<p><strong>Ingested. </strong>A creature must swallow an entire dose of ingested poison to suffer its effects. The dose can be delivered in food or a liquid. You may decide that a partial dose has a reduced effect, such as allowing advantage on the saving throw or dealing only half damage on a failed save.</p>\n<p><strong>Inhaled.</strong> These poisons are powders or gases that take effect when inhaled.

Holding one’s breath is ineffective against inhaled poisons, as they affect nasal membranes, tear ducts, and other parts of the body.</p>\n<p><strong>Injury. </strong>Injury poison can be applied to weapons, ammunition, trap components, and other objects that deal piercing or slashing damage and remains potent until delivered through a wound or washed off.

A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is also unconscious while poisoned in this way. The creature wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it awake.</p>\n<p><strong>Essence of Ether (Inhaled). </strong>A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 8 hours.

{"_id":"87bCRbO4gFLQJXX4","name":"Movement","content":"<p>Swimming across a rushing river, sneaking down a dungeon corridor, scaling a treacherous mountain slope&mdash;all sorts of movement play a key role in fantasy gaming adventures.</p>\n<p>The GM can summarize the adventurers&rsquo; movement without calculating exact distances or travel times: &ldquo;You travel through the forest and find the dungeon entrance late in the evening of the third day.&rdquo; Even in a dungeon, particularly a large dungeon or a cave network, the GM can summarize movement between encounters: &ldquo;After killing the guardian at the entrance to the ancient dwarven stronghold, you consult your map, which leads you through miles of echoing corridors to a chasm bridged by a narrow stone arch.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s important, though, to know how long it takes to get from one spot to another, whether the answer is in days, hours, or minutes. The rules for determining travel time depend on two factors: the speed and travel pace of the creatures moving and the terrain they&rsquo;re moving over.</p>\n<h2>Speed</h2>\n<p>Every character and monster has a speed, which is the distance in feet that the character or monster can walk in 1 round. This number assumes short bursts of energetic movement in the midst of a lifethreatening situation.</p>\n<p>The following rules determine how far a character or monster can move in a minute, an hour, or a day.</p>\n<h3>Travel Pace</h3>\n<p>While traveling, a group of adventurers can move at a normal, fast, or slow pace, as shown on the Travel Pace table. The table states how far the party can move in a period of time and whether the pace has any effect. A fast pace makes characters less perceptive, while a slow pace makes it possible to sneak around and to search an area more carefully.</p>\n<p><strong>Forced March. </strong>The Travel Pace table assumes that characters travel for 8 hours in day. They can push on beyond that limit, at the risk of exhaustion.</p>\n<p>For each additional hour of travel beyond 8 hours, the characters cover the distance shown in the Hour column for their pace, and each character must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of the hour. The DC is 10 + 1 for each hour past 8 hours. On a failed saving throw, a character suffers one level of @Compendium[pergashaFoundryvtt.rules.apBZudO4UA1wj7aC]{Exhaustion}.</p>\n<p><strong>Mounts and Vehicles. </strong>For short spans of time (up to an hour), many animals move much faster than humanoids. A mounted character can ride at a gallop for about an hour, covering twice the usual distance for a fast pace. If fresh mounts are available every 8 to 10 miles, characters can cover larger distances at this pace, but this is very rare except in densely populated areas.</p>\n<p>Characters in wagons, carriages, or other land vehicles choose a pace as normal. Characters in a waterborne vessel are limited to the speed of the vessel, and they don&rsquo;t suffer penalties for a fast pace or gain benefits from a slow pace. Depending on the vessel and the size of the crew, ships might be able to travel for up to 24 hours per day.</p>\n<p>Certain special mounts, such as a pegasus or griffon, or special vehicles, such as a @Compendium[pergashaFoundryvtt.items.TjWk2mpNXjDdfIDM]{Carpet of Flying}, allow you to travel more swiftly.</p>\n<table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\"><caption>\n<h4>Travel Pace</h4>\n</caption>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td rowspan=\"2\">Pace</td>\n<td colspan=\"4\">Distance Traveled per . . .</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Minute</td>\n<td>Hour</td>\n<td>Day</td>\n<td>Effect</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Fast</td>\n<td>400 feet</td>\n<td>4 miles</td>\n<td>30 miles</td>\n<td>- 5 penalty to passive Wisdom (Perception) scores</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Normal</td>\n<td>300 feet</td>\n<td>3 miles</td>\n<td>24 miles</td>\n<td>&mdash;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Slow</td>\n<td>200 feet</td>\n<td>2 miles</td>\n<td>18 miles</td>\n<td>Able to use stealth</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Difficult Terrain</h3>\n<p>The travel speeds given in the Travel Pace table assume relatively simple terrain: roads, open plains, or clear dungeon corridors. But adventurers often face dense forests, deep swamps, rubble-filled ruins, steep mountains, and ice-covered ground&mdash;all considered difficult terrain.</p>\n<p>You move at half speed in difficult terrain&mdash; moving 1 foot in difficult terrain costs 2 feet of speed&mdash;so you can cover only half the normal distance in a minute, an hour, or a day.</p>\n<h2>Special Types of Movement</h2>\n<p>Movement through dangerous dungeons or wilderness areas often involves more than simply walking. Adventurers might have to climb, crawl, swim, or jump to get where they need to go.</p>\n<h3>Climbing, Swimming, and Crawling</h3>\n<p>While climbing or swimming, each foot of movement costs 1 extra foot (2 extra feet in difficult terrain), unless a creature has a climbing or swimming speed. At the GM&rsquo;s option, climbing a slippery vertical surface or one with few handholds requires a successful Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, gaining any distance in rough water might require a successful Strength (Athletics) check.</p>\n<h3>Jumping</h3>\n<p>Your Strength determines how far you can jump.</p>\n<p><strong>Long Jump. </strong>When you make a long jump, you cover a number of feet up to your Strength score if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing long jump, you can leap only half that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement.</p>\n<p>This rule assumes that the height of your jump doesn&rsquo;t matter, such as a jump across a stream or chasm. At your GM&rsquo;s option, you must succeed on a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check to clear a low obstacle (no taller than a quarter of the jump&rsquo;s distance), such as a hedge or low wall. Otherwise, you hit it.</p>\n<p>When you land in difficult terrain, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to land on your feet. Otherwise, you land prone.</p>\n<p><strong>High Jump. </strong>When you make a high jump, you leap into the air a number of feet equal to 3 + your Strength modifier if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing high jump, you can jump only half that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement. In some circumstances, your GM might allow you to make a Strength (Athletics) check to jump higher than you normally can.</p>\n<p>You can extend your arms half your height above yourself during the jump. Thus, you can reach above you a distance equal to the height of the jump plus 1&frac12; times your height.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}}

If cooked successfully, everyone who eats the hot meal regains 1 spent Hit Die. A creature can only regain Hit Die from a hot meal once per day. (Proficiencies: Survival or Cook’s Utensils)</p>\n<p class=\"userscript-MsoNormalCxSpMiddle\">      Before you serve the meal, roll your Cook’s Utensils or a Wisdom (Survival) check to see how well you prepared everything. Meals spoil after an hour, losing any restorative properties.</p>\n<p class=\"userscript-MsoNormalCxSpMiddle\">      <strong>Exceptional</strong> <strong>Success: </strong>The meal is extraordinary and recovers an extra Hit Die to each creature that eats the meal.</p>\n<p class=\"userscript-MsoNormalCxSpMiddle\">      <strong>Success:</strong> The meal is well made.</p>\n<p class=\"userscript-MsoNormalCxSpLast\">      <strong>Failure:</strong> You spoiled the meal and wasted the ingredients. No one can eat your cooking and gain any restorative properties.</p>\n<h2>Brew Drinks</h2>\n<p class=\"userscript-MsoNormalCxSpFirst\">If you are proficient with Brewer’s Supplies or Wisdom (Survival) and have the right tools, you can prepare drinks for the group. This requires a campfire and brewing supplies such as a pot. You may attempt one of the following activities provided you have the appropriate proficiency and supplies:</p>\n<p class=\"userscript-MsoNormalCxSpMiddle\"><strong>    </strong>•<strong>  Create</strong> <strong>Potable Water:</strong> Your knowledge of brewing enables you to purify water that would otherwise be undrinkable. As part of a long rest, you can purify up to 6 rations of water, or 1 ration as part of a short rest. (Proficiency: Brewer’s Supplies)</p>\n<p class=\"userscript-MsoNormalCxSpMiddle\"><strong>    </strong>•<strong>  Brew a Restorative:</strong> As part of a short rest or camping activities, you turn some potable water into a tasty, hot drink.  You use one ration of water to make 5 portions that must be enjoyed immediately. Everyone who drinks a fresh restorative regains 1 spent Hit Die. A creature can only benefit from a brewed restorative once per day. (Proficiency: Brewer’s Supplies)</p>\n<p class=\"userscript-MsoNormalCxSpMiddle\"><strong>    </strong>•<strong>  Brew a Balm: </strong>With a few herbs you turn some basic water rations into a delicious, soothing drink—one ration per two drinks. Everyone who drinks a fresh balm gains 1d4 + 1 hit points. A creature can only benefit from a balm once per day. (Proficiency: Survival or Brewer’s Supplies)</p>\n<p class=\"userscript-MsoNormalCxSpMiddle\">      Before you serve the drinks, roll your Brewer’s Supplies or a Wisdom (Survival) check to see how well you prepared everything. Your brews lose their restorative properties after an hour.</p>\n<p class=\"userscript-MsoNormalCxSpMiddle\">      <strong>Exceptional</strong> <strong>Success: </strong>The balms are of superior quality and everyone who drinks gains 1d6+1 hit points.</p>\n<p class=\"userscript-MsoNormalCxSpMiddle\"><strong>    Success:</strong> The drinks are well made.</p>\n<p class=\"userscript-MsoNormalCxSpLast\"><strong>    Failure:</strong> You spoiled the brew and wasted the ingredients—no one can stomach your drinks.</p>\n<h2>Forage and Gather</h2>\n<p class=\"userscript-MsoNormalCxSpFirst\">Foraging for supplies and food is a crucial part of survival. Not all areas are equally generous in their bounty, but a clever survivalist will know how to make the most of what it available. Knowledge in Nature, Herbalism, or Survival is necessary to find useful—and safe—supplies in the wild.</p>\n<p class=\"userscript-MsoNormalCxSpMiddle\">      <strong>Exceptional Success:</strong> You gather enough supplies to feed or cook a meal for two creatures.</p>\n<p class=\"userscript-MsoNormalCxSpMiddle\"><strong>    Success:</strong> You gather enough supplies to feed or cook a meal for one creature.</p>\n<p class=\"userscript-MsoNormalCxSpLast\"><strong>    Failure:</strong> You are unable to find anything safe or useful.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:'gill sans nova cond xbd' , sans-serif;color:#df5327\"> </span></p>\n<h2 class=\"arjulian\">Lookout</h2>\n<p>Lacking any camp defense is risky—and stupid. The lookout oversees security and watches for potential threats so that others can rest.</p>\n<p>If you are the lookout, roll an Intelligence (Survival) check to see how well you secure camp against potential dangers. If you have any tools, equipment, trained pets, or abilities that may help, you may roll your check with advantage.</p>\n<p>Being on lookout takes focus. If you are on lookout duty, you cannot join in any camp activities besides eating, drinking, and sleeping.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Exceptional Success: </strong>Gain an Inspiration Point.</li>\n<li><strong>Success: </strong>You noted weak spots in the camp’s defense and secured them.</li>\n<li><strong>Failure: </strong>You did not find gaps in camp’s security. You have disadvantage on Perception checks against any would-be intruders while camping.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"ruleBox\"><hr />\n<h3 class=\"arjulian ruleBoxTitle p-2\"><strong>Ambushed</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"p-2\">A warm campfire and the smell of delicious, hot food can attract attention out in the dark wilds—from cruel bandits, to hungry bears, to bloodthirsty cultists. If you let your guard down, you might find both your sleep and your life cut surprisingly short.</p>\n<p class=\"p-2\">If an intruder approaches, the lookout rolls a Wisdom (Perception) check against the intruder's Stealth:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Success:</strong> The lookout detects the intruders and may rouse the party with enough time for people to don light armor.</li>\n<li><strong>Failure:</strong> The lookout—and the rest of the party—are caught off-guard and surprised.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong style=\"font-size:1.125em\">False Alarms</strong></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ruleBox\"><strong> </strong>\n<p class=\"p-2\">It’s easy to worry about every shadowed movement and every distant noise in the dark.</p>\n<p class=\"p-2\">Occasionally, the GM may ask the lookout to make a Wisdom (Insight) roll to detect a false alarm:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Success: </strong>The lookout realizes that it’s just a false alarm and doesn’t rouse the party.</li>\n<li><strong>Failure: </strong>The lookout wakes the party unnecessarily. Their sleep is disturbed for the rest of the night.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n</div>\n<h2>Perform</h2>\n<p class=\"userscript-MsoNormalCxSpFirst\">If you know how to play an instrument, dance, or sing, you can attempt to perform for the group. Roll a Charisma or Dexterity (Performance) check to see how well you perform.</p>\n<p class=\"userscript-MsoNormalCxSpMiddle\">      <strong>Exceptional</strong> <strong>Success: </strong>Your performance was amazing. Your party members gain an additional bonus equal to your Charisma or Dexterity modifier to their camping checks.</p>\n<p class=\"userscript-MsoNormalCxSpMiddle\">      <strong>Success:</strong> You perform well and entertain your allies. Your party members gain a d4 bonus to their camping checks. This bonus increases by one die category when you reach certain levels: 5th (d6), 11th (d8), and 17th (d10).</p>\n<p class=\"userscript-MsoNormalCxSpLast\">      <strong>Failure:</strong> You made an embarrassing mistake.</p>\n<h2>Tell Story</h2>\n<p class=\"userscript-MsoNormalCxSpFirst\">Everyone likes to hear a good story. If you are proficient in Mysteriums, History, Psionics, are literate and carrying an interesting text, or have the Skald feat—you can attempt to tell a captivating story to the group. Roll a Charisma (Performance) check.</p>\n<p class=\"userscript-MsoNormalCxSpMiddle\">      <strong>Exceptional</strong> <strong>Success: </strong>Your story moves the soul. Choose two party members other than yourself or the lookout—those characters gain a point of inspiration.</p>\n<p class=\"userscript-MsoNormalCxSpMiddle\"><strong>    Success:</strong> Your story is well told and inspires an ally. Choose a party member other than yourself or the lookout—that character gains a point of inspiration.</p>\n<p class=\"userscript-MsoNormalCxSpLast\">      <strong>Failure:</strong> You made an embarrassing mistake.</p>\n<h2>Tinker with an Item</h2>\n<p class=\"userscript-MsoNormalCxSpFirst\">Sometimes, you find unusual items that have no clear purpose. If you are proficient in Mysteriums or with Tinker’s Tools, you can attempt to piece together the capabilities of mysteriums and oddities. Roll an Intelligence (Mysterium or Tinker’s Tools) check.</p>\n<p class=\"userscript-MsoNormalCxSpMiddle\"><strong>    Exceptional</strong> <strong>Success: </strong>You can understand the usage of two items.</p>\n<p class=\"userscript-MsoNormalCxSpMiddle\"><strong>    Success:</strong> You can understand the usage of one item.</p>\n<p class=\"userscript-MsoNormalCxSpLast\">      <strong>Failure:</strong> Oops! The gadget triggers harmlessly, giving you a slight hint about what it may do.</p>\n<h2>Relax or Meditate</h2>\n<p class=\"userscript-MsoNormalCxSpFirst\">If you prefer to spend some time alone—meditating, painting, whittling, watching the stars—you can do so. Roll a Wisdom ability check to see if you can unwind.</p>\n<p class=\"userscript-MsoNormalCxSpMiddle\">      <strong>Exceptional</strong> <strong>Success: </strong>Your mind is refreshed, and your spirit inspired. Select two out of the three: one point of inspiration, your Intelligence modifier in Psi Points, or remove one level of Fatigue. You cannot double up on any options.</p>\n<p class=\"userscript-MsoNormalCxSpMiddle\">      <strong>Success:</strong> You feel inspired by your seclusion—gain a point of inspiration, your Intelligence modifier in Psi Points, or remove one level of Fatigue.</p>\n<p class=\"userscript-MsoNormalCxSpLast\">      <strong>Failure:</strong> You couldn’t relax as something—or someone—was irritating you too much.</p>\n<h2>Sleeping</h2>\n<p class=\"userscript-MsoNormalCxSpFirst\">Sometimes rest is the best medicine. When you attempt to sleep, make a sleeping check (Constitution check) against the Camping Check DC. If you are sleeping in a bedroll, tent, or other comfortable arrangement, you roll with advantage. On the other hand, if you are wearing armor, you roll with disadvantage.</p>\n<p class=\"userscript-MsoNormalCxSpMiddle\">      Even though the lookout is on active guard duty, they can still make a sleeping check. They roll with disadvantage because it is hard to feel fully refreshed with split sleep or after a night on watch.</p>\n<p class=\"userscript-MsoNormalCxSpMiddle\">      <strong>Success:</strong> Your sleep was deep and undisrupted. Regain 1 spent Hit Die in addition to other long rest benefits.</p>\n<p class=\"userscript-MsoNormalCxSpMiddle\">      <strong>Failure:</strong> You were restless. You still gain the usual long rest benefits.</p>\n<p class=\"userscript-MsoNormalCxSpLast\">      <strong>Critical failure:</strong> You cannot regain any levels of exhaustion regardless of other long rest benefits.</p>\n<h2>Packing Up</h2>\n<p class=\"userscript-MsoNormalCxSpFirst\">Once you decide to continue your journey, it is time to pack up your campsite. The amount of time it takes depends on the size and permanency of your camp and whether you need to disguise your presence.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DI11opiBN9KroioG":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pergashaFoundryvtt.rules.ei4esVo9XkUXRccq"}}}

{"_id":"BffmI2fRdtO9sgni","name":"Mounted Combat","content":"<p>A knight charging into battle on a warhorse, a wizard casting spells from the back of a griffon, or a cleric soaring through the sky on a pegasus all enjoy the benefits of speed and mobility that a mount can provide.</p>\n<p>A willing creature that is at least one size larger than you and that has an appropriate anatomy can serve as a mount, using the following rules.</p>\n<h2>Mounting and Dismounting</h2>\n<p>Once during your move, you can mount a creature that is within 5 feet of you or dismount. Doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed. For example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15 feet of movement to mount a horse. Therefore, you can’t mount it if you don’t have 15 feet of movement left or if your speed is 0.</p>\n<p>If an effect moves your mount against its will while you’re on it, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall off the mount, landing prone in a space within 5 feet of it. If you’re knocked prone while mounted, you must make the same saving throw.</p>\n<p>If your mount is knocked prone, you can use your reaction to dismount it as it falls and land on your feet. Otherwise, you are dismounted and fall prone in a space within 5 feet it.</p>\n<h2>Controlling a Mount</h2>\n<p>While you’re mounted, you have two options. You can either control the mount or allow it to act independently. Intelligent creatures, such as dragons, act independently.</p>\n<p>You can control a mount only if it has been trained to accept a rider. Domesticated horses, donkeys, and similar creatures are assumed to have such training. The initiative of a controlled mount changes to match yours when you mount it. It moves as you direct it, and it has only three action options: Dash, Disengage, and Dodge. A controlled mount can move and act even on the turn that you mount it.</p>\n<p>An independent mount retains its place in the initiative order. Bearing a rider puts no restrictions on the actions the mount can take, and it moves and acts as it wishes. It might flee from combat, rush to attack and devour a badly injured foe, or otherwise act against your wishes.</p>\n<p>In either case, if the mount provokes an opportunity attack while you’re on it, the attacker can target you or the mount.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}}
{"_id":"C7jIR7IeUctcRwPj","name":"Psionics","content":"<h1 class=\"arjulian section-title\">Psionics</h1>\n<p>Psionics is the power of the mind over matter and reality. If the mind believes, reality is changed, and in Pergasha, the minds of all sentient creatures have been touched by this ability. When magic was taken from the desert, the psionic web strengthened, connecting the consciousness of the ancestral entities, spirits of nature, and the very will of the land.</p>\n<p>Practitioners of psionics understand that reality is neither fixed nor objective, but phenomenical and intersubjective, and that a powerful mind can battle the current consensus of reality and impose its own. This requires physical training and mental prowess, and in most cases, the will and intelligence needed to do so are rare. Something about the nature of the Sundering has given the denizens of Pergasha a measure of innate ability.</p>\n<p>Psionics are the powers of the awakened mind, a transcendental state of being in which awesome feats that defy the physical and magical rules are possible. The power of the mind alters the reality in its core, imposing its will to change the laws of reality and shaping it to their whims. While changing objective reality to subjective desires is complicated and difficult, most people in Pergasha can shift some aspect in their favor for brief moments. Only the most experienced mystic adepts become masters who slowly, painstakingly deceive reality. When they progress in their illumination, they can achieve more daunting effects effortlessly, shaping reality at their whim.</p>\n<h2 class=\"arjulian\">Boundaries</h2>\n<p>Psionics draw power directly of your conscious mind, so your mind has to be sharp and sound to use them. You can’t use any of your psionic powers if you have some condition that prevents you from thinking clearly such as charmed, frightened, incapacitated, poisoned, or stunned. Also, if you are enduring great physical pain, the GM may rule that you lack the mind to access your psionic abilities. Finally, you must expend an extra Psi Point to use an ability for each level of exhaustion you have.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, physical bounds that normally restrict other casters, such as simple physical paralysis, being restrained or held in a grapple, do not impede a psionic character to use its powers. However, you can’t use effects that require sight if you are blinded.</p>\n<p>The nature of psionics means it is often difficult to ascertain who or what is targeting you. For this reason, no one gains advantage on psionic attacks for being hidden or surprising targets.</p>\n<h2 class=\"arjulian\">Psionics and Rage</h2>\n<p>If you are a Barbarian and enter Rage, you lack the mental acuity to use psionic powers that require concentration and finesse, and you cannot switch your psionic focus. While raging, you can activate abilities from disciplines that do not require concentration so long as they are from the Immortal Order. The physical nature of that order is compatible with the state of mind of a raging individual. Psionic Talents and disciplines from orders outside of the Immortal Order cannot be used while you are raging. However, you can maintain your rage by attacking enemies with psionic abilities within the Immortal Order.</p>\n<h2 class=\"arjulian\">Psi Points</h2>\n<p>You have an internal pool of mental energy that can be used to fuel effects. This energy is represented by Psi Points. Each psionic discipline describes several effects that you can create by spending a certain number of Psi Points on them. A psionic talent does not require any expenditure of Psi Points, and you can use them without any limit besides normal exhaustion.</p>\n<h2 class=\"arjulian\">Psychic Limit</h2>\n<p>Your mind, powerful as it is, isn’t omnipotent…yet. You have a hard limit in which you can warp the reality consensus. This limit is represented by the maximum number of Psi Points you can spend to activate effects of psionic disciplines in a single turn. This limit includes your action, bonus action, and reaction and is based on your character level, as shown in the Psi Limit column of the Progression Chart.</p>\n<p>For example, as a 3rd-level character, you can spend no more than 3 Psi Points on a discipline each time you use it, independently of how many Psi Points you have. If you spend 2 points to use an action, you have 1 point left that you may spend for a bonus action or a reaction later. Budget your points wisely.</p>\n<h2 class=\"arjulian\">Psychic Focus</h2>\n<p>You can focus your subconscious mind into one discipline you know to draw passive benefits from it. These benefits vary from discipline to discipline, and you can only focus on one discipline at a time until you have the Psionic Mastery feature. Your psychic focus ends when you are <em>incapacitated, frightened, charmed</em> or<em> stunned</em>, when you change your focus to another, or when you elect to do so. Some features or abilities may require for your focus to be relinquished in order to activate them.</p>\n<p>You choose your psychic focus when you finish a long rest and may shift it later as an action. You can only shift your focus once per short rest, to a maximum of three shifts each day.</p>\n<h2 class=\"arjulian\">Psionic Mastery</h2>\n<p>At 11th level, your mastery over your psionic energy allows you to push your mind beyond its normal limits. Choose a discipline you know. All the benefits of its psychic focus are permanent to you and don’t count against your psychic focus limit. This enables you to choose another discipline you know to have as your psychic focus and still gain its benefits.</p>\n<p>You also gain that discipline’s Mastery effects, described in each discipline. You must be able to afford the Psi Point cost if there is one. As normal, a Mastery focus still ends when you are <em>incapacitated, frightened, charmed</em> or<em> stunned</em>.</p>\n<p>You gain a second Mastery when you reach the 20th level. When you reach 17th level, you gain the Mastery Improvement feature which removes the Concentration tag on any effects of your Mastery discipline, if applicable.</p>\n<h2 class=\"arjulian\">Psionic Disciplines and Talents</h2>\n<p>Psionic talents and disciplines are the heart of a mystic’s craft. They are the mental exercises and psionic formulae used to forge will into tangible effects.</p>\n<p>Psionic disciplines were each discovered by different orders and tend to reflect their creators’ specialties. You can learn any discipline regardless of its associated order although you will benefit from using disciplines from orders that align with your base class and its primary ability score.</p>\n<p>Psionics draw power directly of your conscious mind, so your mind has to be sharp and sound to use them. You can’t use any of your psionic disciplines or talents if you have some condition that alters your mind such as <em>charmed, frightened, incapacitated, poisoned</em> or<em> stunned</em>. Being under mental stress, such as with a temporary madness, can also weirdly interact with your psionics, provoking strange effects, and for each Exhaustion level you have, your Talent’s Psi Points cost increases by 1.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://pergasha.dreadful-odysseys.com/content/psionics.html\">Psionics</a> for a detailled list of Disciplines and Talents.</p>\n<h2 class=\"arjulian\">Using a Discipline</h2>\n<p>Each psionic discipline has several ways you can use it and all contained in its description. The discipline specifies the type of action and number of psi points it requires. It also details whether you must concentrate on its effects, how many targets it affects, what saving throws it requires, and so on.</p>\n<p>The following sections go into more detail on using a discipline.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3 class=\"arjulian\"><strong>Psychic Focus</strong></h3>\n<p>The Psychic Focus section of a discipline describes the benefit you gain when you choose that discipline for your psychic focus. You can only have one focus active at a time, but a focus does not require concentration as other discipline effects may.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3 class=\"arjulian\"><strong>Power Options and Psi Points</strong></h3>\n<p>A discipline provides different powers to activate with your Psi Points. Each power has a name, and the Psi Point cost of that option appears in parentheses after its name. You must spend that number of Psi Points to use that option while abiding by your psi limit. If you don’t have enough Psi Points left, or the cost is above your Psi limit, you can’t use the option.</p>\n<p>Some options show a range of Psi Points rather than a specific cost. To use that option, you must spend a number of points within that range while still abiding by your Psi limit. Some options let you spend additional Psi Points to increase an effect’s potency. Again, you must abide by your Psi limit, and you must spend all the points when you first use the discipline; you can’t decide to spend additional points once you see the discipline in action.</p>\n<p>Each option notes specific information about its effect, including any action required to use it and its range.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3 class=\"arjulian\"><strong>Components</strong></h3>\n<p>Disciplines don’t require the components that many spells require. Using a discipline requires no spoken words, gestures, or materials. The power of psionics comes from the mind.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3 class=\"arjulian\"><strong>Duration</strong></h3>\n<p>An effect option in a discipline specifies how long its effect lasts.</p>\n<p><strong>Instantaneous. </strong>If no duration is specified, the effect of the option is instantaneous.</p>\n<p><strong>Concentration. </strong>Some options require concentration to maintain their effects. This requirement is noted with “conc.” after the option’s psi point cost. The “conc.” notation is followed by the maximum duration of the concentration. For example, if an option says “conc., 1 min.,” you can concentrate on its effect for up to 1 minute. Concentrating on a discipline follows the same rules as concentrating on a spell. This rule means you can’t concentrate on two disciplines at the same time. (See chapter 10, “Spellcasting,” in the <em>Player’s Handbook</em> for how concentration works.)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3 class=\"arjulian\"><strong>Targets and Areas of Effect</strong></h3>\n<p>Psionic disciplines use the same rules as spells for determining targets and areas of effect, as presented in chapter 10, “Spellcasting,” of the <em>Player’s Handbook</em>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3 class=\"arjulian\"><strong>Saving Throws and Attack Rolls</strong></h3>\n<p>If a discipline requires a saving throw, it specifies the type of save and the results of a successful or failed saving throw. The DC for any ability is 8 + your proficiency modifier + the modifier to the applicable ability score.</p>\n<p>Some disciplines require you to make an attack roll to determine whether the discipline’s effect hits its target. The attack roll uses the ability determined by the discipline’s order. The discipline’s category determines which ability score is applicable. When more than one ability score is listed, you select which score you will use.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Avatar: </strong>Charisma or Intelligence</li>\n<li><strong>Awakened: </strong>Intelligence</li>\n<li><strong>Far Hand: </strong>Dexterity or Intelligence</li>\n<li><strong>Immortal: </strong>Strength or Constitution</li>\n<li><strong>Nomad: </strong>Intelligence or Wisdom</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h3 class=\"arjulian\"> </h3>\n<h3 class=\"arjulian\"><strong>Combining Psionic Effects</strong></h3>\n<p>The effects of different psionic disciplines add together while the durations of the disciplines overlap. Likewise, different options from a psionic discipline combine if they are active at the same time. However, a specific option from a psionic discipline doesn’t combine with itself if the option is used multiple times. Instead, the most potent effect—usually dependent on how many Psi Points were used to create the effect— applies while the durations of the effects overlap.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 class=\"arjulian\">Using a Talent</h2>\n<p>Psionic talents are minor abilities that require psionic aptitude but don’t drain your reservoir of psionic power. Talents are similar to disciplines and use the same rules, but with three important exceptions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can never use your psychic focus on a talent.</li>\n<li>Talents don’t require you to spend Psi Points to use them.</li>\n<li>Talents aren’t linked to Mystic Orders.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>The DC for any talent is 8 + your proficiency modifier + your Intelligence modifier.       </em></p>\n<h2>Burn</h2>\n<p>Another key feature of a psionic talent is the ability to overcharge it, enabling a burst of power unavailable through other means. This feature is called Burn, and each talent has its burn listed at the end of its description.</p>\n<p>A burn uses the same action economy associated with the talent unless specified otherwise. Once you burn a talent, you cannot use that specific talent until you take a full rest. </p>\n<p>In addition,<span style=\"font-weight:bold;color:#ff0000\"> you must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw (DC = 15) or suffer one level of Fatigue.</span> If a specific burn has additional side effects, it will be listed in its description. If a talent lists more than one burn option, you must pick which ability you activate.</p>\n<p>You can burn any talent you have, but each talent can only be burned once before needing to be recharged with a <span style=\"font-weight:bold\">full rest.</span> Also, the <span style=\"color:#ff0000;font-weight:bold\">DC for the Intelligence saving throw to avoid Fatigue increases by 2 for each burn you take after the first.</span><em>   </em></p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DI11opiBN9KroioG":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.WjXI97Dr3MYCAHVb"}}}

A character is considered bloodied when they have lost half of their hit points—when bloodied, they have taken a cut or bruise.</p>\n<p class=\"userscript-MsoNormalCxSpMiddle\">      Some monsters may react differently to you when you are bloodied—becoming frenzied or blood-thirsty—while others may have an easier time detecting you by scent.</p>\n<p class=\"userscript-MsoNormalCxSpLast\">      If you are bloodied, it’s a little harder to recover stamina. While bloodied, you must use a bandage, healer’s kit, or similar first-aid to spend Hit Dice and recover hit points when resting.</p>\n<p class=\"userscript-MsoNormalCxSpLast\"> </p>\n<h3>Exhaustion</h3>\n<p class=\"userscript-MsoNormalCxSpFirst\">Some special abilities and environmental hazards, such as starvation and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaustion. This condition covers all effects from casual exhaustion to life drain and is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect’s description.</p>\n<p class=\"userscript-MsoNormalCxSpMiddle\">      For each level of exhaustion you have, any psionic abilities require 1 extra Psi Point to activate, including Talents.</p>\n<p class=\"userscript-MsoNormalCxSpLast\">      If you have 4 or more levels of exhaustion, you must take a full rest to recover.

When an attacker reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack, the attacker can knock the creature out. The attacker can make this choice the instant the damage is dealt. The creature falls unconscious and is stable.</p>\n<h3> </h3>\n<h3>Dying</h3>\n<p class=\"userscript-MsoNormal\">When you drop to 0 hit points and start dying, you gain one level of exhaustion that comes into effect immediately when you are stabilized. You cannot gain more than one level of exhaustion due to dropping to 0 hit points in the same combat. This exhaustion lingers until you properly rest and recover, or an ability lifts it from you.</p>\n<h3> </h3>\n<h3>Stabilizing a Dying Character</h3>\n<p class=\"userscript-MsoNormalCxSpFirst\">Whenever you start your turn with 0 hit points, you must make a special saving throw, called a death saving throw, to determine whether you creep closer to death or hang onto life.</p>\n<p class=\"userscript-MsoNormalCxSpMiddle\">      When performing a Death Save, you must meet or exceed a DC with a d20 roll. An ally can attempt a DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check to help stabilize you. If your ally uses a healer’s kit or similar equipment, they have advantage on the roll. A success on that roll lowers your DC as shown below, while a critical success stabilizes you immediately.</p>\n<p class=\"userscript-MsoNormalCxSpLast\">      After you are stabilized, you suffer one level of exhaustion. If you roll a natural 20 on a Death Save, you are stabilized, suffer one level of exhaustion, and awaken with 1 + your Constitution modifier in hit points (minimum 1).

If your party is able to recover your body, bury it, and throw an appropriately lavish funeral (at least 1 common barter for each of your character levels per person), they can gain one boon from you from beyond the grave. Each character gains 1 Inspiration Point for commemorating you and your memory well, <em>and</em> the party gains 1 Milestone.</p>\n<h3> </h3>\n<h3>Your Will</h3>\n<p class=\"userscript-MsoNormalCxSpFirst\">You can leave a will behind to confirm the heirs to your property. This can be arranged in retrospect with the GM after the character's death if necessary. You can will your property to your new character, the party (with limitations), or to NPCs in your backstory. The reading of the will usually takes place at your funeral, or before the introduction of your new character.</p>\n<p class=\"userscript-MsoNormalCxSpMiddle\">      This might be the last opportunity for your character to say any final words, so make the most of it.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DI11opiBN9KroioG":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.nsDozpZTiGGY0of2"}}}
{"_id":"I70MQGSOHJicYgLC","name":"Traps","content":"<p>Traps can be found almost anywhere. One wrong step in an ancient tomb might trigger a series of scything blades, which cleave through armor and bone. The seemingly innocuous vines that hang over a cave entrance might grasp and choke anyone who pushes through them. A net hidden among the trees might drop on travelers who pass underneath. In a fantasy game, unwary adventurers can fall to their deaths, be burned alive, or fall under a fusillade of poisoned darts.</p>\n<p>A trap can be either mechanical or magical in nature. <strong>Mechanical traps </strong>include pits, arrow traps, falling blocks, water-filled rooms, whirling blades, and anything else that depends on a mechanism to operate. <strong>Magic traps</strong> are either magical device traps or spell traps. Magical device traps initiate spell effects when activated. Spell traps are spells such as glyph of warding and symbol that function as traps.</p>\n<h2>Traps in Play</h2>\n<p>When adventurers come across a trap, you need to know how the trap is triggered and what it does, as well as the possibility for the characters to detect the trap and to disable or avoid it.</p>\n<h3>Triggering a Trap</h3>\n<p>Most traps are triggered when a creature goes somewhere or touches something that the trap&rsquo;s creator wanted to protect. Common triggers include stepping on a pressure plate or a false section of floor, pulling a trip wire, turning a doorknob, and using the wrong key in a lock. Magic traps are often set to go off when a creature enters an area or touches an object. Some magic traps (such as the @Compendium[pergashaFoundryvtt.spells.pB7XVYwdGNcUG935]{Glyph of Warding} spell) have more complicated trigger conditions, including a password that prevents the trap from activating.</p>\n<h3>Detecting and Disabling a Trap</h3>\n<p>Usually, some element of a trap is visible to careful inspection. Characters might notice an uneven flagstone that conceals a pressure plate, spot the gleam of light off a trip wire, notice small holes in the walls from which jets of flame will erupt, or otherwise detect something that points to a trap&rsquo;s presence.</p>\n<p>A trap&rsquo;s description specifies the checks and DCs needed to detect it, disable it, or both. A character actively looking for a trap can attempt a Wisdom (Perception) check against the trap&rsquo;s DC. You can also compare the DC to detect the trap with each character&rsquo;s passive Wisdom (Perception) score to determine whether anyone in the party notices the trap in passing. If the adventurers detect a trap before triggering it, they might be able to disarm it, either permanently or long enough to move past it. You might call for an Intelligence (Investigation) check for a character to deduce what needs to be done, followed by a Dexterity check using thieves&rsquo; tools to perform the necessary sabotage.</p>\n<p>Any character can attempt an Intelligence (Arcana) check to detect or disarm a magic trap, in addition to any other checks noted in the trap&rsquo;s description. The DCs are the same regardless of the check used. In addition, @Compendium[pergashaFoundryvtt.spells.15Fa6q1nH27XfbR8]{Dispel Magic} has a chance of disabling most magic traps. A magic trap&rsquo;s description provides the DC for the ability check made when you use <em>dispel magic</em>.</p>\n<p>In most cases, a trap&rsquo;s description is clear enough that you can adjudicate whether a character&rsquo;s actions locate or foil the trap. As with many situations, you shouldn&rsquo;t allow die rolling to override clever play and good planning. Use your common sense, drawing on the trap&rsquo;s description to determine what happens. No trap&rsquo;s design can anticipate every possible action that the characters might attempt.</p>\n<p>You should allow a character to discover a trap without making an ability check if an action would clearly reveal the trap&rsquo;s presence. For example, if a character lifts a rug that conceals a pressure plate, the character has found the trigger and no check is required.</p>\n<p>Foiling traps can be a little more complicated. Consider a trapped treasure chest. If the chest is opened without first pulling on the two handles set in its sides, a mechanism inside fires a hail of poison needles toward anyone in front of it. After inspecting the chest and making a few checks, the characters are still unsure if it&rsquo;s trapped. Rather than simply open the chest, they prop a shield in front of it and push the chest open at a distance with an iron rod. In this case, the trap still triggers, but the hail of needles fires harmlessly into the shield.</p>\n<p>Traps are often designed with mechanisms that allow them to be disarmed or bypassed. Intelligent monsters that place traps in or around their lairs need ways to get past those traps without harming themselves. Such traps might have hidden levers that disable their triggers, or a secret door might conceal a passage that goes around the trap.</p>\n<h3>Trap Effects</h3>\n<p>The effects of traps can range from inconvenient to deadly, making use of elements such as arrows, spikes, blades, poison, toxic gas, blasts of fire, and deep pits. The deadliest traps combine multiple elements to kill, injure, contain, or drive off any creature unfortunate enough to trigger them. A trap&rsquo;s description specifies what happens when it is triggered.</p>\n<p>The attack bonus of a trap, the save DC to resist its effects, and the damage it deals can vary depending on the trap&rsquo;s severity. Use the Trap Save DCs and Attack Bonuses table and the Damage Severity by Level table for suggestions based on three levels of trap severity.</p>\n<p>A trap intended to be a <strong>setback</strong> is unlikely to kill or seriously harm characters of the indicated levels, whereas a <strong>dangerous</strong> trap is likely to seriously injure (and potentially kill) characters of the indicated levels. A <strong>deadly</strong> trap is likely to kill characters of the indicated levels.</p>\n<table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\"><caption>\n<h4>Trap Save DCs and Attack Bonuses</h4>\n</caption>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td>Trap Danger</td>\n<td>Save DC</td>\n<td>Attack Bonus</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Setback</td>\n<td>10&ndash;11</td>\n<td>+3 to +5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Dangerous</td>\n<td>12&ndash;15</td>\n<td>+6 to +8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Deadly</td>\n<td>16&ndash;20</td>\n<td>+9 to +12</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\"><caption>\n<h4>Damage Severity by Level</h4>\n</caption>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td>Character Level</td>\n<td>Setback</td>\n<td>Dangerous</td>\n<td>Deadly</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1st&ndash;4th</td>\n<td>1d10</td>\n<td>2d10</td>\n<td>4d10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5th&ndash;10th</td>\n<td>2d10</td>\n<td>4d10</td>\n<td>10d10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11th&ndash;16th</td>\n<td>4d10</td>\n<td>10d10</td>\n<td>18d10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17th&ndash;20th</td>\n<td>10d10</td>\n<td>18d10</td>\n<td>24d10</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Complex Traps</h3>\n<p>Complex traps work like standard traps, except once activated they execute a series of actions each round. A complex trap turns the process of dealing with a trap into something more like a combat encounter.</p>\n<p>When a complex trap activates, it rolls initiative. The trap&rsquo;s description includes an initiative bonus. On its turn, the trap activates again, often taking an action. It might make successive attacks against intruders, create an effect that changes over time, or otherwise produce a dynamic challenge. Otherwise, the complex trap can be detected and disabled or bypassed in the usual ways.</p>\n<p>For example, a trap that causes a room to slowly flood works best as a complex trap. On the trap&rsquo;s turn, the water level rises. After several rounds, the room is completely flooded.</p>\n<h2>Sample Traps</h2>\n<p>The magical and mechanical traps presented here vary in deadliness and are presented in alphabetical order.</p>\n<h3>Collapsing Roof</h3>\n<p><em>Mechanical trap</em></p>\n<p>This trap uses a trip wire to collapse the supports keeping an unstable section of a ceiling in place.</p>\n<p>The trip wire is 3 inches off the ground and stretches between two support beams. The DC to spot the trip wire is 10. A successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves&rsquo; tools disables the trip wire harmlessly. A character without thieves&rsquo; tools can attempt this check with disadvantage using any edged weapon or edged tool. On a failed check, the trap triggers.</p>\n<p>Anyone who inspects the beams can easily determine that they are merely wedged in place. As an action, a character can knock over a beam, causing the trap to trigger.</p>\n<p>The ceiling above the trip wire is in bad repair, and anyone who can see it can tell that it&rsquo;s in danger of collapse.</p>\n<p>When the trap is triggered, the unstable ceiling collapses. Any creature in the area beneath the unstable section must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Once the trap is triggered, the floor of the area is filled with rubble and becomes difficult terrain.</p>\n<h3>Falling Net</h3>\n<p><em>Mechanical trap</em></p>\n<p>This trap uses a trip wire to release a net suspended from the ceiling.</p>\n<p>The trip wire is 3 inches off the ground and stretches between two columns or trees. The net is hidden by cobwebs or foliage. The DC to spot the trip wire and net is 10. A successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves&rsquo; tools breaks the trip wire harmlessly. A character without thieves&rsquo; tools can attempt this check with disadvantage using any edged weapon or edged tool. On a failed check, the trap triggers.</p>\n<p>When the trap is triggered, the net is released, covering a 10-foot-square area. Those in the area are trapped under the net and restrained, and those that fail a DC 10 Strength saving throw are also knocked prone. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. The net has AC 10 and 20 hit points. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) destroys a 5-foot-square section of it, freeing any creature trapped in that section.</p>\n<h3>Fire-Breathing Statue</h3>\n<p><em>Magic trap</em></p>\n<p>This trap is activated when an intruder steps on a hidden pressure plate, releasing a magical gout of flame from a nearby statue. The statue can be of anything, including a dragon or a wizard casting a spell.</p>\n<p>The DC is 15 to spot the pressure plate, as well as faint scorch marks on the floor and walls. A spell or other effect that can sense the presence of magic, such as detect magic, reveals an aura of evocation magic around the statue.</p>\n<p>The trap activates when more than 20 pounds of weight is placed on the pressure plate, causing the statue to release a 30-foot cone of fire. Each creature in the fire must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>\n<p>Wedging an iron spike or other object under the pressure plate prevents the trap from activating. A successful dispel magic (DC 13) cast on the statue destroys the trap.</p>\n<h3>Pits</h3>\n<p><em>Mechanical trap</em></p>\n<p>Four basic pit traps are presented here.</p>\n<p><strong>Simple Pit.</strong> A simple pit trap is a hole dug in the ground. The hole is covered by a large cloth anchored on the pit&rsquo;s edge and camouflaged with dirt and debris.</p>\n<p>The DC to spot the pit is 10. Anyone stepping on the cloth falls through and pulls the cloth down into the pit, taking damage based on the pit&rsquo;s depth (usually 10 feet, but some pits are deeper).</p>\n<p><strong>Hidden Pit. </strong>This pit has a cover constructed from material identical to the floor around it.</p>\n<p>A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check discerns an absence of foot traffic over the section of floor that forms the pit&rsquo;s cover. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check is necessary to confirm that the trapped section of floor is actually the cover of a pit.</p>\n<p>When a creature steps on the cover, it swings open like a trapdoor, causing the intruder to spill into the pit below. The pit is usually 10 or 20 feet deep but can be deeper.</p>\n<p>Once the pit trap is detected, an iron spike or similar object can be wedged between the pit&rsquo;s cover and the surrounding floor in such a way as to prevent the cover from opening, thereby making it safe to cross. The cover can also be magically held shut using the @Compendium[pergashaFoundryvtt.spells.8cse7rit0oswRPUP]{Arcane Lock} spell or similar magic.</p>\n<p><strong>Locking Pit. </strong>This pit trap is identical to a hidden pit trap, with one key exception: the trap door that covers the pit is spring-loaded. After a creature falls into the pit, the cover snaps shut to trap its victim inside.</p>\n<p>A successful DC 20 Strength check is necessary to pry the cover open. The cover can also be smashed open. A character in the pit can also attempt to disable the spring mechanism from the inside with a DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves&rsquo; tools, provided that the mechanism can be reached and the character can see. In some cases, a mechanism (usually hidden behind a secret door nearby) opens the pit.</p>\n<p><strong>Spiked Pit.</strong> This pit trap is a simple, hidden, or locking pit trap with sharpened wooden or iron spikes at the bottom. A creature falling into the pit takes 11 (2d10) piercing damage from the spikes, in addition to any falling damage. Even nastier versions have poison smeared on the spikes. In that case, anyone taking piercing damage from the spikes must also make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking an 22 (4d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>\n<h3>Poison Darts</h3>\n<p><em>Mechanical trap</em></p>\n<p>When a creature steps on a hidden pressure plate, poison-tipped darts shoot from spring-loaded or pressurized tubes cleverly embedded in the surrounding walls. An area might include multiple pressure plates, each one rigged to its own set of darts.</p>\n<p>The tiny holes in the walls are obscured by dust and cobwebs, or cleverly hidden amid bas-reliefs, murals, or frescoes that adorn the walls. The DC to spot them is 15. With a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check, a character can deduce the presence of the pressure plate from variations in the mortar and stone used to create it, compared to the surrounding floor. Wedging an iron spike or other object under the pressure plate prevents the trap from activating. Stuffing the holes with cloth or wax prevents the darts contained within from launching.</p>\n<p>The trap activates when more than 20 pounds of weight is placed on the pressure plate, releasing four darts. Each dart makes a ranged attack with a +8 bonus against a random target within 10 feet of the pressure plate (vision is irrelevant to this attack roll). (If there are no targets in the area, the darts don&rsquo;t hit anything.) A target that is hit takes 2 (1d4) piercing damage and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 11 (2d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>\n<h3>Poison Needle</h3>\n<p><em>Mechanical trap</em></p>\n<p>A poisoned needle is hidden within a treasure chest&rsquo;s lock, or in something else that a creature might open. Opening the chest without the proper key causes the needle to spring out, delivering a dose of poison.</p>\n<p>When the trap is triggered, the needle extends 3 inches straight out from the lock. A creature within range takes 1 piercing damage and 11 (2d10) poison damage, and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour.</p>\n<p>A successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check allows a character to deduce the trap&rsquo;s presence from alterations made to the lock to accommodate the needle. A successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves&rsquo; tools disarms the trap, removing the needle from the lock. Unsuccessfully attempting to pick the lock triggers the trap.</p>\n<h3>Rolling Sphere</h3>\n<p><em>Mechanical trap</em></p>\n<p>When 20 or more pounds of pressure are placed on this trap&rsquo;s pressure plate, a hidden trapdoor in the ceiling opens, releasing a 10-foot-diameter rolling sphere of solid stone.</p>\n<p>With a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, a character can spot the trapdoor and pressure plate. A search of the floor accompanied by a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals variations in the mortar and stone that betray the pressure plate&rsquo;s presence. The same check made while inspecting the ceiling notes variations in the stonework that reveal the trapdoor. Wedging an iron spike or other object under the pressure plate prevents the trap from activating.</p>\n<p>Activation of the sphere requires all creatures present to roll initiative. The sphere rolls initiative with a +8 bonus. On its turn, it moves 60 feet in a straight line. The sphere can move through creatures&rsquo; spaces, and creatures can move through its space, treating it as difficult terrain. Whenever the sphere enters a creature&rsquo;s space or a creature enters its space while it&rsquo;s rolling, that creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 55 (10d10) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone.</p>\n<p>The sphere stops when it hits a wall or similar barrier. It can&rsquo;t go around corners, but smart dungeon builders incorporate gentle, curving turns into nearby passages that allow the sphere to keep moving.</p>\n<p>As an action, a creature within 5 feet of the sphere can attempt to slow it down with a DC 20 Strength check. On a successful check, the sphere&rsquo;s speed is reduced by 15 feet. If the sphere&rsquo;s speed drops to 0, it stops moving and is no longer a threat.</p>\n<h3>Sphere of Annihilation</h3>\n<p><em>Magic trap</em></p>\n<p>Magical, impenetrable darkness fills the gaping mouth of a stone face carved into a wall. The mouth is 2 feet in diameter and roughly circular. No sound issues from it, no light can illuminate the inside of it, and any matter that enters it is instantly obliterated.</p>\n<p>A successful DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check reveals that the mouth contains a @Compendium[pergashaFoundryvtt.items.2YNqk5zm9jDTvd7q]{Sphere of Annihilation} that can&rsquo;t be controlled or moved. It is otherwise identical to a normal <em>sphere of annihilation</em>.</p>\n<p>Some versions of the trap include an enchantment placed on the stone face, such that specified creatures feel an overwhelming urge to approach it and crawl inside its mouth. This effect is otherwise like the <em>sympathy </em>aspect of the @Compendium[pergashaFoundryvtt.spells.GJ2WYm3SQFR0winH]{Antipathy/Sympathy} spell. A successful @Compendium[pergashaFoundryvtt.spells.15Fa6q1nH27XfbR8]{Dispel Magic} (DC 18) removes this enchantment.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}}

For this reason, adventurers have access to a variety of armor types, ranging from leather armor to chain mail to costly plate armor, with several other kinds of armor in between. The Armor table collects the most commonly available types of armor found in the game and separates them into three categories: light armor, medium armor, and heavy armor. Many warriors supplement their armor with a shield.</p>\n<p>The Armor table shows the cost, weight, and other properties of the common types of armor worn in fantasy gaming worlds.</p>\n<p><strong>Armor Proficiency. </strong>Anyone can put on a suit of armor or strap a shield to an arm. Only those proficient in the armor’s use know how to wear it effectively, however. Your class gives you proficiency with certain types of armor. If you wear armor that you lack proficiency with, you have disadvantage on any ability check, saving throw, or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity.</p>\n<p><strong>Armor Class (AC).</strong> Armor protects its wearer from attacks. The armor (and shield) you wear determines your base Armor Class</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2><strong>Armor Properties</strong></h2>\n<p>Refer to the @Compendium[pergashaFoundryvtt.rules.wjk6SXkt1eaApY6z]{Armor

If you track hit points for the object, divide it into Large or smaller sections, and track each section&rsquo;s hit points separately. Destroying one of those sections could ruin the entire object. For example, a Gargantuan statue of a human might topple over when one of its Large legs is reduced to 0 hit points.</p>\n<p><strong>Objects and Damage Types. </strong>Objects are immune to poison and psychic damage. You might decide that some damage types are more effective against a particular object or substance than others. For example, bludgeoning damage works well for smashing things but not for cutting through rope or leather. Paper or cloth objects might be vulnerable to fire and lightning damage. A pick can chip away stone but can&rsquo;t effectively cut down a tree. As always, use your best judgment.</p>\n<p><strong>Damage Threshold. </strong>Big objects such as castle walls often have extra resilience represented by a damage threshold. An object with a damage threshold has immunity to all damage unless it takes an amount of damage from a single attack or effect equal to or greater than its damage threshold, in which case it takes damage as normal. Any damage that fails to meet or exceed the object&rsquo;s damage threshold is considered superficial and doesn&rsquo;t reduce the object&rsquo;s hit points.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}}

It takes training and skill to do so very quickly and even more so when faced with an aggressive adversary.</p>\n<p class=\"userscript-MsoNormalCxSpLast\">      You must spend half your movement to stand from prone. When threatened, you can attempt to stand up by making a Dexterity (Acrobatics) or Strength (Athletics) skill check at DC 10 + 2 for each enemy within their reach with you. Failure provokes an attack of opportunity reaction from all opponents within reach. If any opportunity attack roll beats your AC by 10 or more, you remain prone.</p>\n<p class=\"userscript-MsoNormalCxSpLast\"> </p>\n<h2 class=\"userscript-MsoNormalCxSpLast\"><span style=\"color:#333333;font-family:inherit;font-size:18px;font-weight:bold\">Susceptible (New)</span></h2>\n<h3> </h3>\n<p class=\"userscript-MsoNormal\">Susceptibility is lesser variant of Vulnerability. Creatures susceptible to a damage type take extra damage from that damage type. Susceptibility has damage type and a value (typically 5) or a die size. For example, if a creature has Fire Susceptibility 1d10, then any time it takes fire damage, it takes an extra 1d10 fire damage.</p>\n<p class=\"userscript-MsoNormal\"> </p>\n<div style=\"border:solid #722711 1.0pt;padding:3.0pt 6.0pt 3.0pt 6.0pt;background:#722711\">\n<h2><span style=\"color:#f7f7f7\">Combat Actions</span></h2>\n</div>\n<p class=\"userscript-MsoNormalCxSpFirst\">Combat Actions are common martial techniques available to anyone of any class. When you use your action to Attack, you can choose to use one Combat Action until the start of your next turn.</p>\n<p class=\"userscript-MsoNormalCxSpMiddle\">To use a Combat Action, your weapon must have one of the properties listed next to its name, and you must be proficient with it.</p>\n<p class=\"userscript-MsoNormalCxSpLast\"> </p>\n<h4> </h4>\n<h2>Aim (Ranged)</h2>\n<p class=\"userscript-MsoNormal\">Before you make an attack with a ranged weapon that you are proficient with, you can choose to use your bonus action to aim. You gain a +2 bonus to your next attack. This bonus can only be applied once per attack action.</p>\n<h4> </h4>\n<h2>Body-Shield</h2>\n<p class=\"userscript-MsoNormalCxSpFirst\">While a creature is grappled by you, you may use half your movement to make an opposed grapple check against that creature in order to position it in such a way that it shields you from one or more hostile creatures that you are aware of. If the creature is of your size it provides half cover (+2 AC) or if the creature is one size larger than yourself, three-quarters cover (+5 AC).</p>\n<p class=\"userscript-MsoNormalCxSpLast\">If the grappled creature is stunned, paralyzed or unconscious, the DC for the Strength (Athletics) check is 12.</p>\n<p class=\"userscript-MsoNormalCxSpLast\"> </p>\n<h2><br />Charge</h2>\n<p class=\"userscript-MsoNormalCxSpFirst\">When you move at least 20 feet towards a target, you may declare a charge attack as an action. You must have a clear path towards your target, and nothing should hinder your path (such as difficult terrain or obstacles). If you finish your movement within reach of your target, you may use your action to follow it with one of these options:</p>\n<p class=\"userscript-MsoNormalCxSpMiddle\">      <strong>Strike.</strong> You may make a single melee attack with advantage. The attack deals additional damage equal to the distance you charged divided by 5, up to your Strength or Constitution modifier (your choice, minimum of 1). If you are riding a mounted animal that provides the movement instead of you, you may use its Strength or Constitution instead your own.</p>\n<p class=\"userscript-MsoNormalCxSpMiddle\">      <strong>Slam.</strong> You may perform the Shove action with advantage. If you succeed, the creature is shoved twice the normal distance, or shoved as normal then knocked prone. You may choose to move up to five feet in the direction you are shoving your target. If you fail, you provoke an attack of opportunity from your target.</p>\n<p class=\"userscript-MsoNormalCxSpLast\">      <strong>Tackle.</strong> You may make a single Grapple attempt with advantage. If the Grapple fails, you provoke an attack of opportunity from your target and are knocked prone. If you succeed, both you and your opponent are knocked prone and your target is subjected to the Grappled condition.</p>\n<h4> </h4>\n<h2>Climb onto a Bigger Creature</h2>\n<p class=\"userscript-MsoNormalCxSpFirst\">If one creature wants to jump onto another creature, it can do so by grappling. A small or Medium creature has little chance of making a successful grapple against a Huge or Gargantuan creature, however, unless psionics has granted the grappler supernatural might.</p>\n<p class=\"userscript-MsoNormalCxSpMiddle\">      As an alternative, a suitably large opponent can be treated as terrain for the purpose of jumping onto its back or clinging to a limb. After making any ability checks necessary to get into position and onto the larger creature, the smaller creature uses its action to make a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by the target's Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. If it wins the contest, the smaller creature successfully moves into the target creature's space, the smaller creature moves with the target and has advantage on attack rolls against it.</p>\n<p class=\"userscript-MsoNormalCxSpLast\">      The smaller creature can move around within the larger creature's space, treating the space as difficult terrain. The larger creature's ability to attack the smaller creature depends on the smaller creature's location and is left to your discretion. The larger creature can dislodge the smaller creature as an action—knocking it off, scraping it against a wall, or grabbing and throwing it—by making a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the smaller creature's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. The smaller creature chooses which ability to use.</p>\n<h4> </h4>\n<h2>Feint (Light or Finesse)</h2>\n<p class=\"userscript-MsoNormalCxSpFirst\">Before you make an attack with a light or finesse melee weapon that you are proficient with, you can choose to use half your movement to perform a feint and fake out your opponent.</p>\n<p class=\"userscript-MsoNormalCxSpLast\">      Make a Charisma (Deception) check contested by the target's Wisdom (Insight). If you succeed, you have advantage on that attack.</p>\n<h4> </h4>\n<h2>Flanking</h2>\n<p class=\"userscript-MsoNormalCxSpFirst\">When a creature and at least one of its allies are adjacent to an enemy and on opposite sides or corners of the enemy's space, they flank that enemy, and each of them has +2 on melee attack rolls against that enemy.</p>\n<p class=\"userscript-MsoNormalCxSpMiddle\">      When in doubt about whether two creatures flank an enemy on a grid, trace an imaginary line between the centers of the creatures' spaces. If the line passes through opposite sides or corners of the enemy's space, the enemy is flanked.</p>\n<p class=\"userscript-MsoNormalCxSpLast\">      If a creature is Huge or larger, flanking can only occur if at least half of the squares on opposing sides are being threatened.</p>\n<h4> </h4>\n<h2>Overrun</h2>\n<p class=\"userscript-MsoNormal\">When a creature tries to move through a hostile creature's space, the mover can try to force its way through by overrunning the hostile creature. As an action or a bonus action, the mover makes a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the hostile creature's Strength (Athletics) check. The creature attempting the overrun has advantage on this check if it is larger than the hostile creature, or disadvantage if it is smaller. If the mover wins the contest, it can move through the hostile creature's space once this turn.</p>\n<h4> </h4>\n<h2>Power Attack (Heavy)</h2>\n<p class=\"userscript-MsoNormal\">Before you make an attack with a heavy melee weapon that you are proficient with, you can choose to take a -5 penalty to the attack roll and attempt to put more of your raw strength behind a blow that deals extra damage. If the attack hits, you add 2 + your Strength modifier (minimum 1) to the attack's damage.</p>\n<h4> </h4>\n<h2><br />Raise Shield</h2>\n<p class=\"userscript-MsoNormal\">If you are wielding a shield and you are hit by an attack roll that is equal to or only one greater than your AC, you may use your reaction to interpose your shield between yourself and the attack. The attack deals you no damage, but your shield is damaged in the process. It suffers a -1 penalty to its AC each time you block in this fashion. If your shield's AC reaches 0, it is destroyed.</p>\n<h4> </h4>\n<h2>Shove</h2>\n<p class=\"userscript-MsoNormalCxSpFirst\">Using the Attack action, you can make a special melee attack to shove a creature, either to knock it prone or push it away from you. If you’re able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.</p>\n<p class=\"userscript-MsoNormalCxSpLast\">      The target of your shove must be no more than one size larger than you, and it must be within your reach. You make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). You succeed automatically if the target is incapacitated. If you succeed, you either knock the target prone or push it 5 feet away from you.</p>\n<p class=\"userscript-MsoNormalCxSpLast\"> </p>\n<div style=\"border:solid #722711 1.0pt;padding:3.0pt 6.0pt 3.0pt 6.0pt;background:#722711\">\n<h2><span style=\"color:#f7f7f7\">Critical Failure &amp; Consequences</span></h2>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"userscript-MsoNormalCxSpFirst\">When you roll a 1 on a d20 during combat, you not only may fail in your attack but also you may suffer some other C<em>onsequence</em> as determined by the GM. You may use an Inspiration Point to cancel a consequence. However, if you accept the consequence, you receive an Inspiration Point. You cannot receive an Inspiration Point if you are at your maximum.</p>\n<p class=\"userscript-MsoNormalCxSpFirst\"> </p>\n<p class=\"userscript-MsoNormalCxSpFirst\"> </p>\n<div style=\"border:solid #722711 1.0pt;padding:3.0pt 6.0pt 3.0pt 6.0pt;background:#722711\">\n<h2><span style=\"color:#f7f7f7\">Critical Hits</span></h2>\n</div>\n<p class=\"userscript-MsoNormal\"> </p>\n<p class=\"userscript-MsoNormal\">The other side of the coin is that when you roll a natural 20, you succeed. Rolling a natural 20 or a critical hit for an attack roll doubles the damage dice of the attack. The extra damage dice include the weapon’s damage, sneak attack damage, and any abilities that are triggered <em>before</em> the attack roll is made (for example, paying Psi Points for bonus damage). Any abilities that you trigger as a reaction or result of a successful hit are rolled normally.</p>\n<p class=\"userscript-MsoNormal\"> </p>\n<p class=\"userscript-MsoNormalCxSpFirst\"> </p>\n<div style=\"border-width:1pt 1.5pt;border-color:white #aa3b19;border-style:solid;padding:8pt 6pt;background-image:initial\">\n<p class=\"userscript-SidebarBoxL\"><strong>Example:</strong> Nika the rogue spends 1 Psi Point and uses her bonus action to evoke the psionic power Brute Strike.

She rolls the base damage of 2 (1d4 from her dagger) + 4 (1d6 from sneak attack) + 5 (1d8 from Brute Strike) for a total of <strong>11</strong> base damage. Then she adds her critical hit bonus damage which is the maximum value of all those dice: 4 (dagger) + 6 (sneak attack) + 8 (Brute Strike), for a total of <strong>18</strong>.

{"_id":"YuqnARzhZBeUrCjl","name":"Weapon Properties","content":"<h2>Ammunition. </h2>\n<p>You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.</p>\n<p>If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see “Improvised Weapons” later in the section). A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Beatdown</h2>\n<p>You can use one of your attacks to make a special unarmed attack beating down a defenseless target. If your target is restrained, grappled or prone, you may choose to beat it down with a special melee attack that deals additional damage of the same type as shown in the parenthesis.<br /><br /><strong>Example: </strong><em>Jax unleashes a powerful blow with her maul, knocking the bandit prone on the ground. Kal takes the opportunity to pummel the bandit, dealing 1d4 bludgeoning damage with his unarmed strike and an additional 1d4 bludgeoning damage because he is wearing armored gloves.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Bleed</h2>\n<p>Weapons with the Bleed property can inflict gaping wounds and cause profuse bleeding. The target loses an extra 1 hp at the start of its turns, or extra 2 hp if caused by a critical hit. This property does not stack.<br /><br />To stop the excessive bleeding, a creature must be healed or a successful Medicine check (DC 15) must be performed. Objects, Constructs, Elementals, or creatures that do not bleed are immune to this effect.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Brutal</h2>\n<p>Weapons with the Brutal property deal devastating critical hits. When you score a critical hit, you add your ability modifier to the damage twice instead of once.<br /><br /><strong>Example: </strong><em>Kal aims his chakrams at the rock worm and rolls a natural 20. As per usual, he rolls his initial damage of 4 (1d6), adds the maximum damage for his weapon for the critical hit bonus (6) and adds his Dexterity modifier (+6). Because the chakrams have the Brutal property, he adds his Dexterity modifier again, bringing his total damage to 22 slashing damage to the rock worm.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Bypass</h2>\n<p>Flexible weapons with the Bypass property are unaffected by directly blocking the blow. These weapons ignore the AC bonus from shields. The target can still use the Raise Shield combat action to make your attack miss.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Double</h2>\n<p>This weapon has two striking heads on each side of its haft. When you take the attack action and make a two-handed attack with a double-sided weapon, you can use a bonus action to make a melee attack with the opposite end of the weapon. This attack uses the same ability modifier as the primary attack. The damage for this bonus attack is listed in parenthesis.<br /><br /><strong>Example: </strong><em>The Dervish is a double-bladed weapon. Using two hands to make an attack deals 2d4 slashing damage on a successful hit. Using a bonus action, the wielder can use the other end to make an attack and deal 1d4 slashing damage on a successful hit. Both of these attacks add the wielder’s ability modifier to the damage rolls.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Effective</h2>\n<p>When rolling for damage, roll one additional weapon die then remove the die with the lowest result.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Finesse. </h2>\n<p>When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Free-handed</h2>\n<p>This weapon or shield attaches to the arm, but the hand remains unoccupied. No inventory slots are used while this item is equipped since you are wearing it, but the item takes one minute to don and doff.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Fragile</h2>\n<div id=\"property-8\" class=\"abilities property-desc collapse show\" data-parent=\"#property-list\">\n<p class=\"p-4\">Weapons with the Fragile property cannot withstand the rigors of combat for long. If you make an attack roll with a Fragile weapon but miss the target’s AC by 5 or more, the weapon breaks and cannot be used again.</p>\n<p class=\"p-4\"> </p>\n<h2 class=\"p-4\">Forceful</h2>\n</div>\n<div id=\"property-2\" class=\"abilities property-desc collapse show\" data-parent=\"#property-list\">\n<p class=\"pt-4 pr-4 pl-4 pb-0\">Ranged weapons with the Forceful property deal additional damage due to their stopping power. For each 5 points by which you beat the target’s AC, you may add a damage die up to the value shown in parenthesis.</p>\n<p class=\"pt-4 pr-4 pl-4 pb-0\">                         </p>\n</div>\n<h2>Heavy. </h2>\n<p>Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon’s size and bulk make it too large for a Small creature to use effectively.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Impact</h2>\n<div id=\"property-9\" class=\"abilities property-desc collapse show\" data-parent=\"#property-list\">\n<p class=\"p-4\">Weapons with the Impact property can hit with a singularly boneshaking blow, stunning the target. When landing a critical hit or defeating the target’s AC by 10 or more, the creature becomes Stunned until the end of its next turn if it is no more than one size category larger than you.</p>\n<p class=\"p-4\"> </p>\n</div>\n<h2>Light - <em>Expanded.</em></h2>\n<p>A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two Weapons.<br /><br /><strong>NEW: </strong>The weapon is able to be used just as effectively while you are laying on the ground or while you are standing. When you are prone and attack with this weapon, you do not suffer disadvantage if you are proficient with the weapon.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Limit</h2>\n<div id=\"property-11\" class=\"abilities property-desc collapse show\" data-parent=\"#property-list\">\n<p class=\"p-4\">Weapons with the Limit property impose disadvantage when not used in the specific way described in parenthesis, such as only or never on a mount, or only when stationary.</p>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Loading - <em>Expanded</em>.</h2>\n<div id=\"property-1\" class=\"abilities property-desc collapse show\" data-parent=\"#property-list\">\n<p class=\"p-4\">Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it before needing to reload. To reload, you must spend a number of attacks equal to the value in parenthesis.</p>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Mastery</h2>\n<p>Weapons with the Mastery property require focused training to utilize the ability listed in parentheses. To focus your training on a specific weapon, you must declare your intention to the GM, use the weapon as your primary weapon of choice, and spend downtime training until you reach your next level.<br /><br />If multiple Masteries are listed, you unlock the features in numerical order, requiring focused training for each level of Mastery.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Massive</h2>\n<p>This weapon is incredibly large and heavy. When a creature wields this weapon, it reduces the number of attacks that creature can make with the Attack action by one, to a minimum of one. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Mounted</h2>\n<div id=\"property-14\" class=\"abilities property-desc collapse show\" data-parent=\"#property-list\">\n<p class=\"p-4\">This weapon is normally used while attached to a tripod, wagon, or other bracing mount. While it is mounted, it can’t be moved. You can mount or unmount this weapon as an action. While it is unmounted and the creature wielding it is not prone, this weapon can only be used proficiently by a Medium or larger creature with a Strength score of at least 17.</p>\n<p class=\"p-4\"> </p>\n</div>\n<h2>Opportunistic</h2>\n<div id=\"property-15\" class=\"abilities property-desc collapse show\" data-parent=\"#property-list\">\n<p class=\"p-4\">This weapon is great for striking back at opponents who threaten you. When using your reaction to make an opportunity attack with this weapon, you benefit from advantage to the attack roll.</p>\n<p class=\"p-4\"> </p>\n</div>\n<h2>Parry</h2>\n<div id=\"property-16\" class=\"abilities property-desc collapse show\" data-parent=\"#property-list\">\n<p class=\"p-4\">While wielding this weapon and not wielding a shield, you gain a +1 to your AC against melee attacks. You can only gain the benefit of one weapon with this property at a time.</p>\n<p class=\"p-4\"> </p>\n<h2 class=\"p-4\">Point Blank</h2>\n<p>Ranged weapons with the Point Blank property allow for exact precision when pointing at nearby targets. Attacks with ranged weapons that have this property do not suffer disadvantage when made within 5 feet of a hostile creature.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Quick Reload</h2>\n<div id=\"property-4\" class=\"abilities property-desc collapse show\" data-parent=\"#property-list\">\n<p class=\"p-4\">Weapons with the Quick Reload property can now ignore the Loading property listed.</p>\n<p class=\"p-4\"> </p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2>Range. </h2>\n<p>A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon’s normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon’s long range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can’t attack a target beyond the weapon’s long range.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Reach. </h2>\n<div id=\"property-17\" class=\"abilities property-desc collapse show\" data-parent=\"#property-list\">\n<p class=\"p-4\">The weapon has an extended length. This weapon adds 5 feet to your Reach when you attack with it, and when determining your Reach for attacks of opportunity with it.                         </p>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Returning</h2>\n<div id=\"property-18\" class=\"abilities property-desc collapse show\" data-parent=\"#property-list\">\n<p class=\"p-4\">After you make a thrown attack using a weapon with the Returning property, it automatically returns to your hand at the end of the turn as long as you have a hand free and are proficient with it. Catching a weapon does not require an action or reaction, but you cannot catch it if you are currently unable to take reactions (such as if you are incapacitated or have already used your reaction). If you do not catch the weapon you threw, it lands in a random space within 10 feet of you.</p>\n<p class=\"p-4\"> </p>\n</div>\n<h2>Sharp</h2>\n<div id=\"property-19\" class=\"abilities property-desc collapse show\" data-parent=\"#property-list\">\n<p class=\"p-4\">Sharp weapons can tear through defenses or otherwise leave a target more vulnerable. When landing a critical hit or beating a target’s AC by 10 or more, your attack lowers the creature’s AC is 2 until the end of its next turn.</p>\n<p class=\"p-4\"> </p>\n</div>\n<h2>Shield</h2>\n<div id=\"property-20\" class=\"abilities property-desc collapse show\" data-parent=\"#property-list\">\n<p class=\"p-4\">This weapon is large enough or shaped in a certain way so that you can use it to protect yourself from damage. While wielding this weapon and not wielding a shield, you gain a +1 to your AC. You may only gain the benefit of one weapon with this property at a time.</p>\n<p class=\"p-4\"> </p>\n<h2 class=\"p-4\">Stock</h2>\n<p>Ranged weapons with the Stock property can improve your aim when set on firm ground.<br /><br />If you lay prone and make a ranged attack with it, you can ignore disadvantage when shooting at long range, but you suffer disadvantage if you shoot at targets within close range.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Strength</h2>\n<p>Ranged weapons with the Strength property require raw strength to draw the string. You must have the minimum Strength score as shown in parenthesis in order to use them.</p>\n<p class=\"p-4\"> </p>\n</div>\n<h2>Superheavy</h2>\n<div id=\"property-21\" class=\"abilities property-desc collapse show\" data-parent=\"#property-list\">\n<p class=\"p-4\">This weapon is unusually large for its type. You must have a Strength score of at least 17 to proficiently wield a superheavy weapon. Creatures smaller than Medium size cannot wield a superheavy weapon regardless of their Strength score. This property also counts as the Heavy property.</p>\n<p class=\"p-4\"> </p>\n</div>\n<h2>Sweeping</h2>\n<p>The weapon makes attacks in broad, sweeping motions. You can use your bonus action to make one of your attacks into a special Sweeping attack. If there's another creature adjacent to both you and your target, and your attack roll would hit both of them, your target takes normal damage and the other creature takes 1d6 in damage (this damage is not modified by damage bonus modifiers or other abilities).<br /><br />If there are multiple walls, friendly characters sized Medium or larger adjacent to your target, or other such obstructions adjacent to you, you cannot use this property.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Switch</h2>\n<div id=\"property-23\" class=\"abilities property-desc collapse show\" data-parent=\"#property-list\">\n<p class=\"p-4\">This weapon has two forms. The damage and properties of its second form are listed in parentheses. You can use a bonus action to swap between these forms.</p>\n<p class=\"p-4\"> </p>\n</div>\n<h2>Thrown - <em>Expanded</em>.</h2>\n<p>If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged Attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that Attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee Attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a Handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a Dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the Dagger has the finesse property.<br /><br /><strong>New: </strong>Drawing a Thrown weapon is part of the attack, but you need a free hand. You may use your bonus action to recover any Thrown weapon within your reach. At the end of combat, you can recover all undamaged Thrown weapons by taking up to a minute to search the battlefield.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Two-Handed. </h2>\n<p>This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Velocity</h2>\n<div id=\"property-7\" class=\"abilities property-desc collapse show\" data-parent=\"#property-list\">\n<p class=\"p-4\">When using weapons with the Velocity property, the target does not benefit from any Damage Reduction from armor. If you have two instances of Velocity for an attack, your attack also ignores Soak.</p>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Versatile. </h2>\n<p>This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Vicious</h2>\n<div id=\"property-25\" class=\"abilities property-desc collapse show\" data-parent=\"#property-list\">\n<p class=\"p-4\">If a weapon with the Vicious property deals damage, you may reroll any of the weapon dice if it rolls a value of 1. You must use the new value even if it is also a 1. If you have the Great Weapon Fighting style, the two rerolls stack to 1-3 instead.</p>\n<p class=\"p-4\"> </p>\n</div>\n<h1 style=\"text-align:center\">Improvised Weapons</h1>\n<p>Sometimes characters don’t have their weapons and have to attack with whatever is at hand. An improvised weapon includes any object you can wield in one or two hands, such as broken glass, a table leg, a frying pan, a wagon wheel, or a dead goblin.</p>\n<p>Often, an improvised weapon is similar to an actual weapon and can be treated as such. For example, a table leg is akin to a club. At the GM’s option, a character proficient with a weapon can use a similar object as if it were that weapon and use his or her proficiency bonus.</p>\n<p>An object that bears no resemblance to a weapon deals 1d4 damage (the GM assigns a damage type appropriate to the object). If a character uses a ranged weapon to make a melee attack, or throws a melee weapon that does not have the thrown property, it also deals 1d4 damage. An improvised thrown weapon has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.</p>\n<p> </p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DI11opiBN9KroioG":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.ndqc98dtgXM69moo"}}}

{"_id":"ZGpcG1YEtKIXPMvI","name":"Monsters","content":"<p>A monster&rsquo;s statistics, sometimes referred to as its <strong>stat block</strong>, provide the essential information that you need to run the monster.</p>\n<h2>Size</h2>\n<p>A monster can be Tiny, Small, Medium, Large, Huge, or Gargantuan. The Size Categories table shows how much space a creature of a particular size controls in combat. See the <em>Player&rsquo;s Handbook</em> for more information on creature size and space.</p>\n<table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\"><caption>\n<h4>Size Categories</h4>\n</caption>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td>Size</td>\n<td>Space</td>\n<td>Examples</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Tiny</td>\n<td>2&frac12; by 2&frac12; ft.</td>\n<td>Imp, sprite</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Small</td>\n<td>5 by 5 ft.</td>\n<td>Giant rat, goblin</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Medium</td>\n<td>5 by 5 ft.</td>\n<td>Orc, werewolf</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Large</td>\n<td>10 by 10 ft.</td>\n<td>Hippogriff, ogre</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Huge</td>\n<td>15 by 15 ft.</td>\n<td>Fire giant, treant</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Gargantuan</td>\n<td>20 by 20 ft. or larger</td>\n<td>Kraken, purple worm</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<hr />\n<h4>Modifying Creatures</h4>\n<p>Despite the versatile collection of monsters in this book, you might be at a loss when it comes to finding the perfect creature for part of an adventure. Feel free to tweak an existing creature to make it into something more useful for you, perhaps by borrowing a trait or two from a different monster or by using a <strong>variant</strong> or <strong>template</strong>, such as the ones in this book. Keep in mind that modifying a monster, including when you apply a template to it, might change its challenge rating.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Type</h2>\n<p>A monster&rsquo;s type speaks to its fundamental nature. Certain spells, magic items, class features, and other effects in the game interact in special ways with creatures of a particular type. For example, an <em>arrow of dragon slaying </em>deals extra damage not only to dragons but also other creatures of the dragon type, such as dragon turtles and wyverns.</p>\n<p>The game includes the following monster types, which have no rules of their own.</p>\n<p><strong>Aberrations</strong> are utterly alien beings. Many of them have innate magical abilities drawn from the creature&rsquo;s alien mind rather than the mystical forces of the world. The quintessential aberrations are aboleths, beholders, mind flayers, and slaadi.</p>\n<p><strong>Beasts</strong> are nonhumanoid creatures that are a natural part of the fantasy ecology. Some of them have magical powers, but most are unintelligent and lack any society or language. Beasts include all varieties of ordinary animals, dinosaurs, and giant versions of animals.</p>\n<p><strong>Celestials</strong> are creatures native to the Upper Planes. Many of them are the servants of deities, employed as messengers or agents in the mortal realm and throughout the planes. Celestials are good by nature, so the exceptional celestial who strays from a good alignment is a horrifying rarity. Celestials include angels, couatls, and pegasi.</p>\n<p><strong>Constructs</strong> are made, not born. Some are programmed by their creators to follow a simple set of instructions, while others are imbued with sentience and capable of independent thought. Golems are the iconic constructs. Many creatures native to the outer plane of Mechanus, such as modrons, are constructs shaped from the raw material of the plane by the will of more powerful creatures.</p>\n<p><strong>Dragons</strong> are large reptilian creatures of ancient origin and tremendous power. True dragons, including the good metallic dragons and the evil chromatic dragons, are highly intelligent and have innate magic. Also in this category are creatures distantly related to true dragons, but less powerful, less intelligent, and less magical, such as wyverns and pseudodragons.</p>\n<p><strong>Elementals</strong> are creatures native to the elemental planes. Some creatures of this type are little more than animate masses of their respective elements, including the creatures simply called elementals. Others have biological forms infused with elemental energy. The races of genies, including djinn and efreet, form the most important civilizations on the elemental planes. Other elemental creatures include azers and invisible stalkers.</p>\n<p><strong>Fey</strong> are magical creatures closely tied to the forces of nature. They dwell in twilight groves and misty forests. In some worlds, they are closely tied to the Feywild, also called the Plane of Faerie. Some are also found in the Outer Planes, particularly the planes of Arborea and the Beastlands. Fey include dryads, pixies, and satyrs.</p>\n<p><strong>Fiends</strong> are creatures of wickedness that are native to the Lower Planes. A few are the servants of deities, but many more labor under the leadership of archdevils and demon princes. Evil priests and mages sometimes summon fiends to the material world to do their bidding. If an evil celestial is a rarity, a good fiend is almost inconceivable. Fiends include demons, devils, hell hounds, rakshasas, and yugoloths.</p>\n<p><strong>Giants</strong> tower over humans and their kind. They are humanlike in shape, though some have multiple heads (ettins) or deformities (fomorians). The six varieties of true giant are hill giants, stone giants, frost giants, fire giants, cloud giants, and storm giants. Besides these, creatures such as ogres and trolls are giants.</p>\n<p><strong>Humanoids</strong> are the main peoples of a fantasy gaming world, both civilized and savage, including humans and a tremendous variety of other species. They have language and culture, few if any innate magical abilities (though most humanoids can learn spellcasting), and a bipedal form. The most common humanoid races are the ones most suitable as player characters: humans, dwarves, elves, and halflings. Almost as numerous but far more savage and brutal, and almost uniformly evil, are the races of goblinoids (goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears), orcs, gnolls, lizardfolk, and kobolds.</p>\n<p><strong>Monstrosities</strong> are monsters in the strictest sense&mdash;frightening creatures that are not ordinary, not truly natural, and almost never benign. Some are the results of magical experimentation gone awry (such as owlbears), and others are the product of terrible curses (including minotaurs and yuan-ti). They defy categorization, and in some sense serve as a catch-all category for creatures that don&rsquo;t fit into any other type.</p>\n<p><strong>Oozes</strong> are gelatinous creatures that rarely have a fixed shape. They are mostly subterranean, dwelling in caves and dungeons and feeding on refuse, carrion, or creatures unlucky enough to get in their way. Black puddings and gelatinous cubes are among the most recognizable oozes.</p>\n<p><strong>Plants</strong> in this context are vegetable creatures, not ordinary flora. Most of them are ambulatory, and some are carnivorous. The quintessential plants are the shambling mound and the treant. Fungal creatures such as the gas spore and the myconid also fall into this category.</p>\n<p><strong>Undead</strong> are once-living creatures brought to a horrifying state of undeath through the practice of necromantic magic or some unholy curse. Undead include walking corpses, such as vampires and zombies, as well as bodiless spirits, such as ghosts and specters.</p>\n<h3>Tags</h3>\n<p>A monster might have one or more tags appended to its type, in parentheses. For example, an orc has the <em>humanoid (orc)</em> type. The parenthetical tags provide additional categorization for certain creatures. The tags have no rules of their own, but something in the game, such as a magic item, might refer to them. For instance, a spear that is especially effective at fighting demons would work against any monster that has the demon tag.</p>\n<h2>Alignment</h2>\n<p>A monster&rsquo;s alignment provides a clue to its disposition and how it behaves in a roleplaying or combat situation. For example, a chaotic evil monster might be difficult to reason with and might attack characters on sight, whereas a neutral monster might be willing to negotiate. See the <em>Player&rsquo;s Handbook</em> for descriptions of the different alignments.</p>\n<p>The alignment specified in a monster&rsquo;s stat block is the default. Feel free to depart from it and change a monster&rsquo;s alignment to suit the needs of your campaign. If you want a good-aligned green dragon or an evil storm giant, there&rsquo;s nothing stopping you.</p>\n<p>Some creatures can have <strong>any alignment</strong>. In other words, you choose the monster&rsquo;s alignment. Some monster&rsquo;s alignment entry indicates a tendency or aversion toward law, chaos, good, or evil. For example, a berserker can be any chaotic alignment (chaotic good, chaotic neutral, or chaotic evil), as befits its wild nature.</p>\n<p>Many creatures of low intelligence have no comprehension of law or chaos, good or evil. They don&rsquo;t make moral or ethical choices, but rather act on instinct. These creatures are <strong>unaligned</strong>, which means they don&rsquo;t have an alignment.</p>\n<h2>Armor Class</h2>\n<p>A monster that wears armor or carries a shield has an Armor Class (AC) that takes its armor, shield, and Dexterity into account. Otherwise, a monster&rsquo;s AC is based on its Dexterity modifier and natural armor, if any. If a monster has natural armor, wears armor, or carries a shield, this is noted in parentheses after its AC value.</p>\n<h2>Hit Points</h2>\n<p>A monster usually dies or is destroyed when it drops to 0 hit points. For more on hit points, see the <em>Player&rsquo;s Handbook.</em></p>\n<p>A monster&rsquo;s hit points are presented both as a die expression and as an average number. For example, a monster with 2d8 hit points has 9 hit points on average (2 &times; 4&frac12;).</p>\n<p>A monster&rsquo;s size determines the die used to calculate its hit points, as shown in the Hit Dice by Size table.</p>\n<table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\"><caption>\n<h4>Hit Dice by Size</h4>\n</caption>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td>Monster Size</td>\n<td>Hit Die</td>\n<td>Average HP per Die</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Tiny</td>\n<td>d4</td>\n<td>2&frac12;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Small</td>\n<td>d6</td>\n<td>3&frac12;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Medium</td>\n<td>d8</td>\n<td>4&frac12;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Large</td>\n<td>d10</td>\n<td>5&frac12;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Huge</td>\n<td>d12</td>\n<td>6&frac12;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Gargantuan</td>\n<td>d20</td>\n<td>10&frac12;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>A monster&rsquo;s Constitution modifier also affects the number of hit points it has. Its Constitution modifier is multiplied by the number of Hit Dice it possesses, and the result is added to its hit points. For example, if a monster has a Constitution of 12 (+1 modifier) and 2d8 Hit Dice, it has 2d8 + 2 hit points (average 11).</p>\n<h2>Speed</h2>\n<p>A monster&rsquo;s speed tells you how far it can move on its turn. For more information on speed, see the <em>Player&rsquo;s Handbook</em>.</p>\n<p>All creatures have a walking speed, simply called the monster&rsquo;s speed. Creatures that have no form of ground-based locomotion have a walking speed of 0 feet.</p>\n<p>Some creatures have one or more of the following additional movement modes.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pergashaFoundryvtt.rules.treKHmCjr4aQiVyd]{Burrow}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pergashaFoundryvtt.rules.cvRB5qT2M8wVUGRb]{Climb}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pergashaFoundryvtt.rules.KJHSCRHWW0UuhtoE]{Fly}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pergashaFoundryvtt.rules.J9ppEykIQxUIarUj]{Swim}</p>\n<h2>Ability Scores</h2>\n<p>Every monster has six ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma) and corresponding modifiers. For more information on ability scores and how they&rsquo;re used in play, see the <em>Player&rsquo;s Handbook</em>.</p>\n<h2>Saving Throws</h2>\n<p>The Saving Throws entry is reserved for creatures that are adept at resisting certain kinds of effects. For example, a creature that isn&rsquo;t easily charmed or frightened might gain a bonus on its Wisdom saving throws. Most creatures don&rsquo;t have special saving throw bonuses, in which case this section is absent.</p>\n<p>A saving throw bonus is the sum of a monster&rsquo;s relevant ability modifier and its proficiency bonus, which is determined by the monster&rsquo;s challenge rating (as shown in the Proficiency Bonus by Challenge Rating table).</p>\n<table cellspacing=\"0\"><caption>\n<h4>Proficiency Bonus by Challenge Rating</h4>\n</caption>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td>Challenge</td>\n<td>Proficiency Bonus</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>+ 2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1/8</td>\n<td>+ 2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1/4</td>\n<td>+ 2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1/2</td>\n<td>+ 2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>+ 2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>+ 2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>+ 2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>+ 2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>+ 3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>+ 3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>+ 3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>+ 3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>+ 4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>+ 4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>+ 4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>+ 4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>+ 5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>+ 5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>+ 5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>+ 5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>+ 6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>+ 6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19</td>\n<td>+ 6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>+ 6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>21</td>\n<td>+ 7</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>22</td>\n<td>+ 7</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>23</td>\n<td>+ 7</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>24</td>\n<td>+ 7</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>25</td>\n<td>+ 8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>26</td>\n<td>+ 8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>27</td>\n<td>+ 8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>28</td>\n<td>+ 8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>29</td>\n<td>+ 9</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>30</td>\n<td>+ 9</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Skills</h2>\n<p>The Skills entry is reserved for monsters that are proficient in one or more skills. For example, a monster that is very perceptive and stealthy might have bonuses to Wisdom (Perception) and Dexterity (Stealth) checks.</p>\n<p>A skill bonus is the sum of a monster&rsquo;s relevant ability modifier and its proficiency bonus, which is determined by the monster&rsquo;s challenge rating (as shown in the Proficiency Bonus by Challenge Rating table). Other modifiers might apply. For instance, a monster might have a larger-than-expected bonus (usually double its proficiency bonus) to account for its heightened expertise.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4>Armor, Weapon, and Tool Proficiencies</h4>\n<p>Assume that a creature is proficient with its armor, weapons, and tools. If you swap them out, you decide whether the creature is proficient with its new equipment.</p>\n<p>For example, a hill giant typically wears hide armor and wields a greatclub. You could equip a hill giant with chain mail and a greataxe instead, and assume the giant is proficient with both, one or the other, or neither.</p>\n<p>See the <em>Player&rsquo;s Handbook </em>for rules on using armor or weapons without proficiency.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Vulnerabilities, Resistances, and Immunities</h2>\n<p>Some creatures have vulnerability, resistance, or immunity to certain types of damage. Particular creatures are even resistant or immune to damage from nonmagical attacks (a magical attack is an attack delivered by a spell, a magic item, or another magical source). In addition, some creatures are immune to certain conditions.</p>\n<h2>Senses</h2>\n<p>The Senses entry notes a monster&rsquo;s passive Wisdom (Perception) score, as well as any special senses the monster might have. Special senses are described below.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pergashaFoundryvtt.rules.oag7MR9Omacmhzb7]{Blindsight}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pergashaFoundryvtt.rules.10RNSKCH2hTja3DG]{Darkvision}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pergashaFoundryvtt.rules.MzNASNCgB0Qi2m8p]{Tremorsense}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pergashaFoundryvtt.rules.eeQ4uW3yMwnbIYVs]{Truesight}</p>\n<h2>Languages</h2>\n<p>The languages that a monster can speak are listed in alphabetical order. Sometimes a monster can understand a language but can&rsquo;t speak it, and this is noted in its entry. A &ldquo;&mdash;&rdquo; indicates that a creature neither speaks nor understands any language. </p>\n<h3>Telepathy</h3>\n<p>Telepathy is a magical ability that allows a monster to communicate mentally with another creature within a specified range. The contacted creature doesn&rsquo;t need to share a language with the monster to communicate in this way with it, but it must be able to understand at least one language. A creature without telepathy can receive and respond to telepathic messages but can&rsquo;t initiate or terminate a telepathic conversation.</p>\n<p>A telepathic monster doesn&rsquo;t need to see a contacted creature and can end the telepathic contact at any time. The contact is broken as soon as the two creatures are no longer within range of each other or if the telepathic monster contacts a different creature within range. A telepathic monster can initiate or terminate a telepathic conversation without using an action, but while the monster is incapacitated, it can&rsquo;t initiate telepathic contact, and any current contact is terminated.</p>\n<p>A creature within the area of an @Compendium[pergashaFoundryvtt.spells.Eon0jzGzQRNluTPQ]{Antimagic Field} or in any other location where magic doesn&rsquo;t function can&rsquo;t send or receive telepathic messages.</p>\n<h2>Challenge</h2>\n<p>A monster&rsquo;s <strong>challenge rating</strong> tells you how great a threat the monster is. An appropriately equipped and well-rested party of four adventurers should be able to defeat a monster that has a challenge rating equal to its level without suffering any deaths. For example, a party of four 3rd-level characters should find a monster with a challenge rating of 3 to be a worthy challenge, but not a deadly one.</p>\n<p>Monsters that are significantly weaker than 1st-level characters have a challenge rating lower than 1. Monsters with a challenge rating of 0 are insignificant except in large numbers; those with no effective attacks are worth no experience points, while those that have attacks are worth 10 XP each.</p>\n<p>Some monsters present a greater challenge than even a typical 20th-level party can handle. These monsters have a challenge rating of 21 or higher and are specifically designed to test player skill.</p>\n<h3>Experience Points</h3>\n<p>The number of experience points (XP) a monster is worth is based on its challenge rating. Typically, XP is awarded for defeating the monster, although the GM may also award XP for neutralizing the threat posed by the monster in some other manner.</p>\n<p>Unless something tells you otherwise, a monster summoned by a spell or other magical ability is worth the XP noted in its stat block.</p>\n<table><caption>\n<h4>Experience Points by Challenge Rating</h4>\n</caption>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td>Challenge</td>\n<td>XP</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0 or 10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1/8</td>\n<td>25</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1/4</td>\n<td>50</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1/2</td>\n<td>100</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>200</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>450</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>700</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>1,100</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>1,800</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>2,300</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>2,900</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>3,900</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>5,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>5,900</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>7,200</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>8,400</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>10,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>11,500</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>13,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>15,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>18,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>20,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19</td>\n<td>22,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>25,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>21</td>\n<td>33,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>22</td>\n<td>41,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>23</td>\n<td>50,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>24</td>\n<td>62,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>25</td>\n<td>75,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>26</td>\n<td>90,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>27</td>\n<td>105,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>28</td>\n<td>120,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>29</td>\n<td>135,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>30</td>\n<td>155,000</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Special Traits</h2>\n<p>Special traits (which appear after a monster&rsquo;s challenge rating but before any actions or reactions) are characteristics that are likely to be relevant in a combat encounter and that require some explanation.</p>\n<h3>Innate Spellcasting</h3>\n<p>A monster with the innate ability to cast spells has the Innate Spellcasting special trait. Unless noted otherwise, an innate spell of 1st level or higher is always cast at its lowest possible level and can&rsquo;t be cast at a higher level. If a monster has a cantrip where its level matters and no level is given, use the monster&rsquo;s challenge rating.</p>\n<p>An innate spell can have special rules or restrictions. For example, a drow mage can innately cast the @Compendium[pergashaFoundryvtt.spells.MRxldJd6C4bsBo3O]{Levitate} spell, but the spell has a &ldquo;self only&rdquo; restriction, which means that the spell affects only the drow mage.</p>\n<p>A monster&rsquo;s innate spells can&rsquo;t be swapped out with other spells. If a monster&rsquo;s innate spells don&rsquo;t require attack rolls, no attack bonus is given for them.</p>\n<h3>Spellcasting</h3>\n<p>A monster with the Spellcasting special trait has a spellcaster level and spell slots, which it uses to cast its spells of 1st level and higher (as explained in the <em>Player&rsquo;s Handbook</em>). The spellcaster level is also used for any cantrips included in the feature.</p>\n<p>The monster has a list of spells known or prepared from a specific class. The list might also include spells from a feature in that class, such as the @Compendium[pergashaFoundryvtt.classfeatures.x637K2Icp2ZFM1TB]{Divine Domain} feature of the cleric or the @Compendium[pergashaFoundryvtt.classfeatures.u6Du2P9s81SWuGbi]{Druid Circle} feature of the druid. The monster is considered a member of that class when attuning to or using a magic item that requires membership in the class or access to its spell list.</p>\n<p>A monster can cast a spell from its list at a higher level if it has the spell slot to do so. For example, a drow mage with the 3rd-level @Compendium[pergashaFoundryvtt.spells.IyikgTEOTv701jgQ]{Lightning Bolt} spell can cast it as a 5th-level spell by using one of its 5th-level spell slots.</p>\n<p>You can change the spells that a monster knows or has prepared, replacing any spell on its spell list with a spell of the same level and from the same class list. If you do so, you might cause the monster to be a greater or lesser threat than suggested by its challenge rating</p>\n<h3>Psionics</h3>\n<p>A monster that casts spells using only the power of its mind has the psionics tag added to its Spellcasting or Innate Spellcasting special trait. This tag carries no special rules of its own, but other parts of the game might refer to it. A monster that has this tag typically doesn&rsquo;t require any components to cast its spells.</p>\n<h2>Actions</h2>\n<p>When a monster takes its action, it can choose from the options in the Actions section of its stat block or use one of the actions available to all creatures, such as the Dash or Hide action, as described in the <em>Player&rsquo;s Handbook</em>.</p>\n<h3>Melee and Ranged Attacks</h3>\n<p>The most common actions that a monster will take in combat are melee and ranged attacks. These can be spell attacks or weapon attacks, where the &ldquo;weapon&rdquo; might be a manufactured item or a natural weapon, such as a claw or tail spike. For more information on different kinds of attacks, see the <em>Player&rsquo;s Handbook</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Creature vs. Target. </strong>The target of a melee or ranged attack is usually either one creature or one target, the difference being that a &ldquo;target&rdquo; can be a creature or an object.</p>\n<p><strong>Hit. </strong>Any damage dealt or other effects that occur as a result of an attack hitting a target are described after the &ldquo;Hit&rdquo; notation. You have the option of taking average damage or rolling the damage; for this reason, both the average damage and the die expression are presented.</p>\n<p><strong>Miss.</strong> If an attack has an effect that occurs on a miss, that information is presented after the &ldquo;Miss:&rdquo; notation.</p>\n<h3>Multiattack</h3>\n<p>A creature that can make multiple attacks on its turn has the Multiattack action. A creature can&rsquo;t use Multiattack when making an opportunity attack, which must be a single melee attack.</p>\n<h3>Ammunition</h3>\n<p>A monster carries enough ammunition to make its ranged attacks. You can assume that a monster has 2d4 pieces of ammunition for a thrown weapon attack, and 2d10 pieces of ammunition for a projectile weapon such as a bow or crossbow.</p>\n<h2>Reactions</h2>\n<p>If a monster can do something special with its reaction, that information is contained here. If a creature has no special reaction, this section is absent.</p>\n<h2>Limited Usage</h2>\n<p>Some special abilities have restrictions on the number of times they can be used.</p>\n<p><strong>X/Day. </strong>The notation &ldquo;X/Day&rdquo; means a special ability can be used X number of times and that a monster must finish a long rest to regain expended uses. For example, &ldquo;1/Day&rdquo; means a special ability can be used once and that the monster must finish a long rest to use it again.</p>\n<p><strong>Recharge X&ndash;Y. </strong>The notation &ldquo;Recharge X&ndash;Y&rdquo; means a monster can use a special ability once and that the ability then has a random chance of recharging during each subsequent round of combat. At the start of each of the monster&rsquo;s turns, roll a d6. If the roll is one of the numbers in the recharge notation, the monster regains the use of the special ability. The ability also recharges when the monster finishes a short or long rest.</p>\n<p>For example, &ldquo;Recharge 5&ndash;6&rdquo; means a monster can use the special ability once. Then, at the start of the monster&rsquo;s turn, it regains the use of that ability if it rolls a 5 or 6 on a d6.</p>\n<p><strong>Recharge after a Short or Long Rest. </strong>This notation means that a monster can use a special ability once and then must finish a short or long rest to use it again.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4>Grapple Rules for Monsters</h4>\n<p>Many monsters have special attacks that allow them to quickly grapple prey. When a monster hits with such an attack, it doesn&rsquo;t need to make an additional ability check to determine whether the grapple succeeds, unless the attack says otherwise.</p>\n<p>A creature grappled by the monster can use its action to try to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check against the escape DC in the monster&rsquo;s stat block. If no escape DC is given, assume the DC is 10 + the monster&rsquo;s Strength (Athletics) modifier.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Equipment</h2>\n<p>A stat block rarely refers to equipment, other than armor or weapons used by a monster. A creature that customarily wears clothes, such as a humanoid, is assumed to be dressed appropriately.</p>\n<p>You can equip monsters with additional gear and trinkets however you like, and you decide how much of a monster&rsquo;s equipment is recoverable after the creature is slain and whether any of that equipment is still usable. A battered suit of armor made for a monster is rarely usable by someone else, for instance.</p>\n<p>If a spellcasting monster needs material components to cast its spells, assume that it has the material components it needs to cast the spells in its stat block.</p>\n<h1>Legendary Creatures</h1>\n<p>A legendary creature can do things that ordinary creatures can&rsquo;t. It can take special actions outside its turn, and it might exert magical influence for miles around.</p>\n<p>If a creature assumes the form of a legendary creature, such as through a spell, it doesn&rsquo;t gain that form&rsquo;s legendary actions, lair actions, or regional effects.</p>\n<h2>Legendary Actions</h2>\n<p>A legendary creature can take a certain number of special actions&mdash;called legendary actions&mdash;outside its turn. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature&rsquo;s turn. A creature regains its spent legendary actions at the start of its turn. It can forgo using them, and it can&rsquo;t use them while incapacitated or otherwise unable to take actions. If surprised, it can&rsquo;t use them until after its first turn in the combat.</p>\n<h2>A Legendary Creature&rsquo;s Lair</h2>\n<p>A legendary creature might have a section describing its lair and the special effects it can create while there, either by act of will or simply by being present. Such a section applies only to a legendary creature that spends a great deal of time in its lair.</p>\n<h3>Lair Actions</h3>\n<p>If a legendary creature has lair actions, it can use them to harness the ambient magic in its lair. On initiative count 20 (losing all initiative ties), it can use one of its lair action options. It can&rsquo;t do so while incapacitated or otherwise unable to take actions. If surprised, it can&rsquo;t use one until after its first turn in the combat.</p>\n<h3>Regional Effects</h3>\n<p>The mere presence of a legendary creature can have strange and wondrous effects on its environment, as noted in this section. Regional effects end abruptly or dissipate over time when the legendary creature dies.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}}

{"_id":"Zqh1063GdJVTvoGd","name":"Diseases","content":"<p>A plague ravages the kingdom, setting the adventurers on a quest to find a cure. An adventurer emerges from an ancient tomb, unopened for centuries, and soon finds herself suffering from a wasting illness. A warlock offends some dark power and contracts a strange affliction that spreads whenever he casts spells.</p>\n<p>A simple outbreak might amount to little more than a small drain on party resources, curable by a casting of @Compendium[pergashaFoundryvtt.spells.F0GsG0SJzsIOacwV]{Lesser Restoration}. A more complicated outbreak can form the basis of one or more adventures as characters search for a cure, stop the spread of the disease, and deal with the consequences.</p>\n<p>A disease that does more than infect a few party members is primarily a plot device. The rules help describe the effects of the disease and how it can be cured, but the specifics of how a disease works aren’t bound by a common set of rules. Diseases can affect any creature, and a given illness might or might not pass from one race or kind of creature to another. A plague might affect only constructs or undead, or sweep through a halfling neighborhood but leave other races untouched. What matters is the story you want to tell.</p>\n<h2>Sample Diseases</h2>\n<p>The diseases here illustrate the variety of ways disease can work in the game. Feel free to alter the saving throw DCs, incubation times, symptoms, and other characteristics of these diseases to suit your campaign.</p>\n<h3>Cackle Fever</h3>\n<p>This disease targets humanoids, although gnomes are strangely immune. While in the grips of this disease, victims frequently succumb to fits of mad laughter, giving the disease its common name and its morbid nickname: “the shrieks.”</p>\n<p>Symptoms manifest 1d4 hours after infection and include fever and disorientation. The infected creature gains one level of exhaustion that can’t be removed until the disease is cured.</p>\n<p>Any event that causes the infected creature great stress—including entering combat, taking damage, experiencing fear, or having a nightmare—forces the creature to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5 (1d10) psychic damage and becomes incapacitated with mad laughter for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the mad laughter and the incapacitated condition on a success.</p>\n<p>Any humanoid creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of an infected creature in the throes of mad laughter must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or also become infected with the disease. Once a creature succeeds on this save, it is immune to the mad laughter of that particular infected creature for 24 hours.</p>\n<p>At the end of each long rest, an infected creature can make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the DC for this save and for the save to avoid an attack of mad laughter drops by 1d6. When the saving throw DC drops to 0, the creature recovers from the disease. A creature that fails three of these saving throws gains a randomly determined form of indefinite madness, as described later.</p>\n<h3>Sewer Plague</h3>\n<p>Sewer plague is a generic term for a broad category of illnesses that incubate in sewers, refuse heaps, and stagnant swamps, and which are sometimes transmitted by creatures that dwell in those areas, such as rats and otyughs.</p>\n<p>When a humanoid creature is bitten by a creature that carries the disease, or when it comes into contact with filth or offal contaminated by the disease, the creature must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become infected.</p>\n<p>It takes 1d4 days for sewer plague’s symptoms to manifest in an infected creature. Symptoms include fatigue and cramps. The infected creature suffers one level of exhaustion, and it regains only half the normal number of hit points from spending Hit Dice and no hit points from finishing a long rest.</p>\n<p>At the end of each long rest, an infected creature must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the character gains one level of exhaustion. On a successful save, the character’s exhaustion level decreases by one level. If a successful saving throw reduces the infected creature’s level of exhaustion below 1, the creature recovers from the disease.</p>\n<h3>Sight Rot</h3>\n<p>This painful infection causes bleeding from the eyes and eventually blinds the victim.</p>\n<p>A beast or humanoid that drinks water tainted by sight rot must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become infected. One day after infection, the creature’s vision starts to become blurry. The creature takes a −1 penalty to attack rolls and ability checks that rely on sight. At the end of each long rest after the symptoms appear, the penalty worsens by 1. When it reaches −5, the victim is blinded until its sight is restored by magic such as @Compendium[pergashaFoundryvtt.spells.F0GsG0SJzsIOacwV]{Lesser Restoration} or @Compendium[pergashaFoundryvtt.spells.qcYitWoSMTnKkzM1]{Heal}.</p>\n<p>Sight rot can be cured using a rare flower called Eyebright, which grows in some swamps. Given an hour, a character who has proficiency with an herbalism kit can turn the flower into one dose of ointment. Applied to the eyes before a long rest, one dose of it prevents the disease from worsening after that rest. After three doses, the ointment cures the disease entirely.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}}

{"name":"Help & Teamwork","content":"<div class=\"content note-editor notes\">\n<h2>Help</h2>\n<p>You can take the <em>Help</em> action to grant advantage to an ally if you are proficient in the skill, tool, or another skill or tool that can feasibly be used to assist. For example, if someone is attempting to use Athletics to push a large boulder, your proficiency with Builder’s Tools can be the basis to help your ally.

{"_id":"gJwZ7NM3G52dqlz2","name":"The Order of Combat","permission":{"default":0},"folder":"","flags":{},"content":"<p>A typical combat encounter is a clash between two sides, a flurry of weapon swings, feints, parries, footwork, and spellcasting. The game organizes the chaos of combat into a cycle of rounds and turns. A <strong>round</strong> represents about 6 seconds in the game world. During a round, each participant in a battle takes a <strong>turn</strong>. The order of turns is determined at the beginning of a combat encounter, when everyone rolls initiative. Once everyone has taken a turn, the fight continues to the next round if neither side has defeated the other.</p>\n<hr>\n<h4>Combat Step by Step</h4>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Determine surprise. </strong>The GM determines whether anyone involved in the combat encounter is surprised.</li>\n<li><strong>Establish positions. </strong>The GM decides where all the characters and monsters are located. Given the adventurersʼ marching order or their stated positions in the room or other location, the GM figures out where the adversaries are̶how far away and in what direction.</li>\n<li><strong>Roll initiative.</strong> Everyone involved in the combat encounter rolls initiative, determining the order of combatantsʼ turns.</li>\n<li><strong>Take turns.</strong> Each participant in the battle takes a turn in initiative order.</li>\n<li><strong>Begin the next round. </strong>When everyone involved in the combat has had a turn, the round ends. Repeat step 4 until the fighting stops.</li>\n</ol>\n<hr>\n<h2>Surprise</h2>\n<p>A band of adventurers sneaks up on a bandit camp, springing from the trees to attack them. A gelatinous cube glides down a dungeon passage, unnoticed by the adventurers until the cube engulfs one of them. In these situations, one side of the battle gains surprise over the other.</p>\n<p>The GM determines who might be surprised. If neither side tries to be stealthy, they automatically notice each other. Otherwise, the GM compares the Dexterity (Stealth) checks of anyone hiding with the passive Wisdom (Perception) score of each creature on the opposing side. Any character or monster that doesn’t notice a threat is surprised at the start of the encounter.</p>\n<p>If you’re surprised, you can’t move or take an action on your first turn of the combat, and you can’t take a reaction until that turn ends. A member of a group can be surprised even if the other members aren’t.</p>\n<h2>Initiative</h2>\n<p>Initiative determines the order of turns during combat. When combat starts, every participant makes a Dexterity check to determine their place in the initiative order. The GM makes one roll for an entire group of identical creatures, so each member of the group acts at the same time.</p>\n<p>The GM ranks the combatants in order from the one with the highest Dexterity check total to the one with the lowest. This is the order (called the initiative order) in which they act during each round. The initiative order remains the same from round to round.</p>\n<p>If a tie occurs, the GM decides the order among tied GM-controlled creatures, and the players decide the order among their tied characters. The GM can decide the order if the tie is between a monster and a player character. Optionally, the GM can have the tied characters and monsters each roll a d20 to determine the order, highest roll going first.</p>\n<h2>Your Turn</h2>\n<p>On your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed and take one action. You decide whether to move first or take your action first. Your speed— sometimes called your walking speed—is noted on your character sheet.</p>\n<p>The most common actions you can take are described in the @Compendium[pergashaFoundryvtt.rules.Grj7E9vW0bnFAxuQ]{Actions in Combat} section. Many class features and other abilities provide additional options for your action.</p>\n<p>The @Compendium[pergashaFoundryvtt.rules.0CvBVevL3tyiJrHu]{Movement and Position} section gives the rules for your move.</p>\n<p>You can forgo moving, taking an action, or doing anything at all on your turn. If you can’t decide what to do on your turn, consider taking the Dodge or Ready action, as described in @Compendium[pergashaFoundryvtt.rules.Grj7E9vW0bnFAxuQ]{Actions in Combat}</p>\n<h3>Bonus Actions</h3>\n<p>Various class features, spells, and other abilities let you take an additional action on your turn called a bonus action. The @Compendium[pergashaFoundryvtt.classfeatures.01pcLg6PRu5zGrsb]{Cunning Action} feature, for example, allows a rogue to take a bonus action. You can take a bonus action only when a special ability, spell, or other feature of the game states that you can do something as a bonus action. You otherwise don’t have a bonus action to take.</p>\n<p>You can take only one bonus action on your turn, so you must choose which bonus action to use when you have more than one available.</p>\n<p>You choose when to take a bonus action during your turn, unless the bonus action’s timing is specified, and anything that deprives you of your ability to take actions also prevents you from taking a bonus action.</p>\n<h3>Other Activity on Your Turn</h3>\n<p>Your turn can include a variety of flourishes that require neither your action nor your move.</p>\n<p>You can communicate however you are able, through brief utterances and gestures, as you take your turn.</p>\n<p>You can also interact with one object or feature of the environment for free, during either your move or your action. For example, you could open a door during your move as you stride toward a foe, or you could draw your weapon as part of the same action you use to attack.</p>\n<p>If you want to interact with a second object, you need to use your action. Some magic items and other special objects always require an action to use, as stated in their descriptions.</p>\n<p>The GM might require you to use an action for any of these activities when it needs special care or when it presents an unusual obstacle. For instance, the GM could reasonably expect you to use an action to open a stuck door or turn a crank to lower a drawbridge.</p>\n<h2>Reactions</h2>\n<p>Certain special abilities, spells, and situations allow you to take a special action called a reaction. A reaction is an instant response to a trigger of some kind, which can occur on your turn or on someone else’s. The opportunity attack is the most common type of reaction.</p>\n<p>When you take a reaction, you can’t take another one until the start of your next turn. If the reaction interrupts another creature’s turn, that creature can continue its turn right after the reaction.</p>"}

{"_id":"k168rzSiQrQM0G9i","name":"The Environment","content":"<p>By its nature, adventuring involves delving into places that are dark, dangerous, and full of mysteries to be explored. The rules in this section cover some of the most important ways in which adventurers interact with the environment in such places.</p>\n<h2>Falling</h2>\n<p>When you fall more than 5 feet, you take bludgeoning damage equal to half the distance you fell when you land. Treat falls longer than 1,500 feet as though they were 1,500 feet (750 damage). If you take any damage from a fall, you land <a class=\"btn-inform2\" tabindex=\"0\" title data-trigger=\"focus\" data-toggle=\"popover\" data-boundary=\"window\" data-placement=\"auto\" data-html=\"true\" data-content=\"&lt;p&gt;You’re lying on the ground. You are flat-footed and take a –2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls. The only move actions you can use while you’re &lt;em&gt;prone&lt;/em&gt; are Crawl and Stand. Standing up ends the &lt;em&gt;prone&lt;/em&gt; condition. You can Take Cover while &lt;em&gt;prone&lt;/em&gt; to hunker down and gain greater cover against ranged attacks, even if you don’t have an object to get behind, gaining a +4 circumstance bonus to AC against ranged attacks (but you remain flat-footed).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you would be knocked &lt;em&gt;prone&lt;/em&gt; while you’re Climbing or Flying, you fall (see pages 463–464 for the rules on falling). You can’t be knocked &lt;em&gt;prone&lt;/em&gt; when Swimming.&lt;/p&gt;\" data-original-title=\"&lt;strong&gt;condition: prone&lt;/strong&gt;\">prone</a>. You fall about 500 feet in the first round of falling and about 1,500 feet each round thereafter.</p>\n<h2>Suffocating</h2>\n<p>A creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum of 30 seconds).</p>\n<p>When a creature runs out of breath or is choking, it can survive for a number of rounds equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 round). At the start of its next turn, it drops to 0 hit points and is dying, and it can’t regain hit points or be stabilized until it can breathe again.</p>\n<p>For example, a creature with a Constitution of 14 can hold its breath for 3 minutes. If it starts suffocating, it has 2 rounds to reach air before it drops to 0 hit points.</p>\n<h2>Vision and Light</h2>\n<p>The most fundamental tasks of adventuring— noticing danger, finding hidden objects, hitting an enemy in combat, and targeting a spell, to name just a few—rely heavily on a character’s ability to see. Darkness and other effects that obscure vision can prove a significant hindrance.</p>\n<p>A given area might be lightly or heavily obscured. In a <strong>lightly obscured</strong> area, such as dim light, patchy fog, or moderate foliage, creatures have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.</p>\n<p>A <strong>heavily obscured </strong>area—such as darkness, opaque fog, or dense foliage—blocks vision entirely. A creature effectively suffers from the @Compendium[pergashaFoundryvtt.rules.995mfaI3z7WtY7vK]{blinded} condition when trying to see something in that area.</p>\n<p>The presence or absence of light in an environment creates three categories of illumination: bright light, dim light, and darkness.</p>\n<p><strong>Bright light </strong>lets most creatures see normally. Even gloomy days provide bright light, as do torches, lanterns, fires, and other sources of illumination within a specific radius.</p>\n<p><strong>Dim light</strong>, also called shadows, creates a lightly obscured area. An area of dim light is usually a boundary between a source of bright light, such as a torch, and surrounding darkness. The soft light of twilight and dawn also counts as dim light. A particularly brilliant full moon might bathe the land in dim light.</p>\n<p><strong>Darkness</strong> creates a heavily obscured area. Characters face darkness outdoors at night (even most moonlit nights), within the confines of an unlit dungeon or a subterranean vault, or in an area of magical darkness.</p>\n<h3>Blindsight</h3>\n<p>A creature with blindsight can perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, within a specific radius. Creatures without eyes, such as oozes, and creatures with echolocation or heightened senses, such as bats and true dragons, have this sense.</p>\n<h3>Darkvision</h3>\n<p>Many creatures in fantasy gaming worlds, especially those that dwell underground, have darkvision. Within a specified range, a creature with darkvision can see in darkness as if the darkness were dim light, so areas of darkness are only lightly obscured as far as that creature is concerned. However, the creature can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>\n<h3>Truesight</h3>\n<p>A creature with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in normal and magical darkness, see @Compendium[pergashaFoundryvtt.rules.hMWCeXenROGuhF1K]{invisible} creatures and objects, automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on saving throws against them, and perceives the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by magic. Furthermore, the creature can see into the Ethereal Plane.</p>\n<h2>Food and Water</h2>\n<p>Characters who don’t eat or drink suffer the effects of @Compendium[pergashaFoundryvtt.rules.HbtDq5CjXtLbxrvt]{Exhaustion}. Exhaustion caused by lack of food or water can’t be removed until the character eats and drinks the full required amount.</p>\n<h3>Food</h3>\n<p>A character needs one pound of food per day and can make food last longer by subsisting on half rations. Eating half a pound of food in a day counts as half a day without food.</p>\n<p>A character can go without food for a number of days equal to 3 + his or her Constitution modifier (minimum 1). At the end of each day beyond that limit, a character automatically suffers one level of exhaustion.</p>\n<p>A normal day of eating resets the count of days without food to zero.</p>\n<h3>Water</h3>\n<p>A character needs one gallon of water per day, or two gallons per day if the weather is hot. A character who drinks only half that much water must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion at the end of the day. A character with access to even less water automatically suffers one level of exhaustion at the end of the day.</p>\n<p>If the character already has one or more levels of exhaustion, the character takes two levels in either case.</p>\n<h2>Interacting with Objects</h2>\n<p>A character’s interaction with objects in an environment is often simple to resolve in the game. The player tells the GM that his or her character is doing something, such as moving a lever, and the GM describes what, if anything, happens.</p>\n<p>For example, a character might decide to pull a lever, which might, in turn, raise a portcullis, cause a room to flood with water, or open a secret door in a nearby wall. If the lever is rusted in position, though, a character might need to force it. In such a situation, the GM might call for a Strength check to see whether the character can wrench the lever into place. The GM sets the DC for any such check based on the difficulty of the task.</p>\n<p>Characters can also damage objects with their weapons and spells. Objects are immune to poison and psychic damage, but otherwise they can be affected by physical and magical attacks much like creatures can. The GM determines an object’s Armor Class and hit points, and might decide that certain objects have resistance or immunity to certain kinds of attacks. (It’s hard to cut a rope with a club, for example.) Objects always fail Strength and Dexterity saving throws, and they are immune to effects that require other saves. When an object drops to 0 hit points, it breaks.</p>\n<p>A character can also attempt a Strength check to break an object. The GM sets the DC for any such check.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DI11opiBN9KroioG":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pergashaFoundryvtt.rules.mKsmKfuLvJ3GjPzN"}}}
{"name":"Skills","content":"<div id=\"section9\" class=\"p-2\">\n<h1 class=\"arjulian section-title\">How Skills Work</h1>\n<p>In general, when there are no consequences for failure, a task is deemed impossible to fail, or there are no stressors (such as time) to prevent success, skill checks will not be rolled. Your success is assumed. See more in Passive Knowledge Checks below.</p>\n<p>However, on some occasions, you may decide you’d like to add flavor, pizzazz, or humor to an action or scene. You may opt to roll for these situations.</p>\n<p>When rolls are made, you can be sure they are important!</p>\n<h2 class=\"arjulian\">Passive Knowledge</h2>\n<p>All knowledge checks (History, Nature, Psionics, Mysterium) will be based on a flat value. The value is equal to <strong>10 + your Proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</strong>. Bonuses will be given situationally to those who have specialized knowledge due to backstories. Knowledge checks using this flat value will be used to determine what lore or facts a character knows. This is to represent the knowledge already known and stored in memory.</p>\n<p>Passive knowledge scores will also be used when trying to ascertain known lore in relation to other skills that are not normally knowledge-type skills. For example, blacksmithing requires physical strength, so crafting with these tools requires a skill check. The bonus to the roll is your Proficiency bonus + Strength modifier. However, to determine what you know about blacksmithing or to gauge how well a weapon was made will be a passive knowledge check using your <strong>Intelligence</strong> instead of Strength.</p>\n<p>Knowledge check rolls will be used in cases of research, training, crafting, or other creative uses of the skill. Also, rolls may be made when there are outside stressors or risk upon failure.</p>\n<h2 class=\"arjulian\">Exceptional Success</h2>\n<p>Some abilities or checks may refer to <em>Exceptional Success</em>. Unless specified otherwise, an exceptional success is when you succeed at an ability or skill check by 10 or more than the DC. Not all checks will have results or benefits for exceptional successes, and these are separate from critical successes.</p>\n<h2 class=\"arjulian\">Critical Fails and Successes</h2>\n<p>When you roll a natural 1 when performing a skill check, you fail. You may suffer a Consequence from the GM if the risk of failure is significant but failing is usually punishment enough.</p>\n<p>Rolling a natural 20 almost always means success, but there may be some singularly difficult tasks that cannot be completed with a natural 20 alone. This is a rare situation and will generally be announced in advance of the roll by the GM. For most other skill checks, a natural 20 means you succeed and may gain a boon or additional bonus from doing so.</p>\n<h2 class=\"arjulian\">Help</h2>\n<p>You can take the <em>Help</em> action to grant advantage to an ally if you are proficient in the skill, tool, or another skill or tool that can feasibly be used to assist. For example, if someone is attempting to use Athletics to push a large boulder, your proficiency with Builder’s Tools can be the basis to help your ally. You may roll one of the two dice for advantage or have your ally roll both. You ally adds their normal bonuses to the highest die roll.</p>\n<p>When providing Help to an ally when not in turn order allows more flexibility – the character with the highest bonus may be the one to roll advantage and add bonuses. There may be exceptions if it is critical that a particular individual perform a roll.</p>\n<p>Once someone has Helped an ally on a check, it generally cannot be attempted again.</p>\n<h2 class=\"arjulian\">Teamwork</h2>\n<p>In most cases, you cannot roll multiple attempts for the same action. Instead, you can work with allies to make one attempt as successful as possible.</p>\n<p>Anyone with a relevant skill or ability may help you attempt something—the first person grants you advantage via the Help action, and every additional person grants you a +1 bonus. If the roll fails, however, everyone involved is liable for the consequences.</p>\n<p>Bonuses granted may differ if your allies have abilities that specify such. If an ally grants bonuses through these abilities, they do not give the teamwork bonus. An ally that used the Skald feat to grant bonuses to a skill check cannot give the teamwork bonus for that specific skill check.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h1 class=\"arjulian\">Skill Proficiencies</h1>\n<p>Listed here are available skills and their associated ability scores. Arcana and Religion have been replaced with Psionics and Mysteriums.</p>\n<p>An important distinction for knowledge-based skills is that there are few tomes and even fewer libraries in Pergasha. After the Sundering, knowledge is primarily passed down via oral tradition, telepathically, and through visual arts.</p>\n<h2 class=\"arjulian\">Abilities and Associated Skills</h2>\n<table class=\"table-sm table table-striped table-responsive-sm table-bordered\" style=\"max-width:700px\">\n<thead class=\"thead-dark\">\n<tr>\n<th class=\"text-center\">Ability</th>\n<th>Skills</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"text-center\">Strength</td>\n<td>Athletics</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"text-center\">Dexterity</td>\n<td>Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, Stealth</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"text-center\">Intelligence</td>\n<td>History, Investigation, Mysteriums, Nature, Psionics</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"text-center\">Wisdom</td>\n<td>Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, Perception, Survival</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"text-center\">Charisma</td>\n<td>Deception, Intimidation, Performance, Persuasion</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3 class=\"arjulian\"><strong>New Skills Descriptions</strong></h3>\n<h4 class=\"arjulian\"><strong>Mysteriums</strong></h4>\n<p>Your Intelligence (Mysteriums) check measures your ability to recall lore about mysteriums, relics, devices, known areas where caches have been found, and common or known uses of these items.

Bulky armor imposes disadvantage on Strength (Athletics) and Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks to swim, climb, run, and similar activities. These penalties can be avoided if your Strength score is at least 2 points higher than the armor’s Strength requirement. <br /><br />This property also impedes your movement when standing from Prone.

As an action, you can slam the shield into the ground and brace yourself behind it. While anchored this way, a wall shield ceases to grant you a bonus to AC.

{"name":"Movement and Position","content":"<p>In combat, characters and monsters are in constant motion, often using movement and position to gain the upper hand.</p>\n<p>On your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed. You can use as much or as little of your speed as you like on your turn, following the rules here.</p>\n<p>Your movement can include jumping, climbing, and swimming. These different modes of movement can be combined with walking, or they can constitute your entire move. However you’re moving, you deduct the distance of each part of your move from your speed until it is used up or until you are done moving.</p>\n<h2>Breaking Up Your Move</h2>\n<p>You can break up your movement on your turn, using some of your speed before and after your action. For example, if you have a speed of 30 feet, you can move 10 feet, take your action, and then move 20 feet.</p>\n<h3>Moving between Attacks</h3>\n<p>If you take an action that includes more than one weapon attack, you can break up your movement even further by moving between those attacks. For example, a fighter who can make two attacks with the Extra Attack feature and who has a speed of 25 feet could move 10 feet, make an attack, move 15 feet, and then attack again.</p>\n<h3>Using Different Speeds</h3>\n<p>If you have more than one speed, such as your walking speed and a flying speed, you can switch back and forth between your speeds during your move. Whenever you switch, subtract the distance you’ve already moved from the new speed. The result determines how much farther you can move. If the result is 0 or less, you can’t use the new speed during the current move.</p>\n<p>For example, if you have a speed of 30 and a flying speed of 60 because a wizard cast the fly spell on you, you could fly 20 feet, then walk 10 feet, and then leap into the air to fly 30 feet more.</p>\n<h2>Difficult Terrain</h2>\n<p>Combat rarely takes place in bare rooms or on featureless plains. Boulder-strewn caverns, briarchoked forests, treacherous staircases—the setting of a typical fight contains difficult terrain.</p>\n<p>Every foot of movement in difficult terrain costs 1 extra foot. This rule is true even if multiple things in a space count as difficult terrain.</p>\n<p>Low furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs, snow, and shallow bogs are examples of difficult terrain. The space of another creature, whether hostile or not, also counts as difficult terrain.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<hr />\n<h4>Interacting with Objects Around You</h4>\n<p>Here are a few examples of the sorts of thing you can do in tandem with your movement and action:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>draw or sheathe a sword</li>\n<li>open or close a door</li>\n<li>withdraw a potion from your backpack</li>\n<li>pick up a dropped axe</li>\n<li>take a bauble from a table</li>\n<li>remove a ring from your finger</li>\n<li>stuff some food into your mouth</li>\n<li>plant a banner in the ground</li>\n<li>fish a few coins from your belt pouch</li>\n<li>drink all the ale in a flagon</li>\n<li>throw a lever or a switch</li>\n<li>pull a torch from a sconce</li>\n<li>take a book from a shelf you can reach</li>\n<li>extinguish a small flame</li>\n<li>don a mask</li>\n<li>pull the hood of your cloak up and over your head</li>\n<li>put your ear to a door</li>\n<li>kick a small stone</li>\n<li>turn a key in a lock</li>\n<li>tap the floor with a 10-foot pole</li>\n<li>hand an item to another character</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h2>Moving Around Other Creatures</h2>\n<p>You can move through a nonhostile creature’s space. In contrast, you can move through a hostile creature’s space only if the creature is at least two sizes larger or smaller than you. Remember that another creature’s space is difficult terrain for you.</p>\n<p>Whether a creature is a friend or an enemy, you can’t willingly end your move in its space.</p>\n<p>If you leave a hostile creature’s reach during your move, you provoke an opportunity attack.</p>\n<h2>Flying Movement</h2>\n<p>Flying creatures enjoy many benefits of mobility, but they must also deal with the danger of falling. If a flying creature is knocked prone, has its speed reduced to 0, or is otherwise deprived of the ability to move, the creature falls, unless it has the ability to hover or it is being held aloft by magic, such as by the @Compendium[pergashaFoundryvtt.spells.yfbK8gZqESlaoY5t]{Fly} spell.</p>\n<h2>Creature Size</h2>\n<p>Each creature takes up a different amount of space. The Size Categories table shows how much space a creature of a particular size controls in combat. Objects sometimes use the same size categories.</p>\n<table border=\"0\"><caption>\n<h4>Size Categories</h4>\n</caption>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td>Size</td>\n<td>Space</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Tiny</td>\n<td>2½ by 2½ ft.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Small</td>\n<td>5 by 5 ft.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Medium</td>\n<td>5 by 5 ft.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Large</td>\n<td>10 by 10 ft.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Huge</td>\n<td>15 by 15 ft.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Gargantuan</td>\n<td>20 by 20 ft. or larger</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Space</h3>\n<p>A creature’s space is the area in feet that it effectively controls in combat, not an expression of its physical dimensions. A typical Medium creature isn’t 5 feet wide, for example, but it does control a space that wide. If a Medium hobgoblin stands in a 5- foot-wide doorway, other creatures can’t get through unless the hobgoblin lets them.</p>\n<p>A creature’s space also reflects the area it needs to fight effectively. For that reason, there’s a limit to the number of creatures that can surround another creature in combat. Assuming Medium combatants, eight creatures can fit in a 5-foot radius around another one.</p>\n<p>Because larger creatures take up more space, fewer of them can surround a creature. If five Large creatures crowd around a Medium or smaller one, there’s little room for anyone else. In contrast, as many as twenty Medium creatures can surround a Gargantuan one.</p>\n<h3>Squeezing into a Smaller Space</h3>\n<p>A creature can squeeze through a space that is large enough for a creature one size smaller than it. Thus, a Large creature can squeeze through a passage that’s only 5 feet wide. While squeezing through a space, a creature must spend 1 extra foot for every foot it moves there, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage while it’s in the smaller space.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DI11opiBN9KroioG":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pergashaFoundryvtt.rules.0CvBVevL3tyiJrHu"}},"_id":"xvlHPP6Q5pjQM55Q"}

{"_id":"C7jIR7IeUctcRwPj","name":"Psionics","content":"<h1 class=\"arjulian section-title\">Psionics</h1>\n<p>Psionics is the power of the mind over matter and reality. If the mind believes, reality is changed, and in Pergasha, the minds of all sentient creatures have been touched by this ability. When magic was taken from the desert, the psionic web strengthened, connecting the consciousness of the ancestral entities, spirits of nature, and the very will of the land.</p>\n<p>Practitioners of psionics understand that reality is neither fixed nor objective, but phenomenical and intersubjective, and that a powerful mind can battle the current consensus of reality and impose its own. This requires physical training and mental prowess, and in most cases, the will and intelligence needed to do so are rare. Something about the nature of the Sundering has given the denizens of Pergasha a measure of innate ability.</p>\n<p>Psionics are the powers of the awakened mind, a transcendental state of being in which awesome feats that defy the physical and magical rules are possible. The power of the mind alters the reality in its core, imposing its will to change the laws of reality and shaping it to their whims. While changing objective reality to subjective desires is complicated and difficult, most people in Pergasha can shift some aspect in their favor for brief moments. Only the most experienced mystic adepts become masters who slowly, painstakingly deceive reality. When they progress in their illumination, they can achieve more daunting effects effortlessly, shaping reality at their whim.</p>\n<h2 class=\"arjulian\">Boundaries</h2>\n<p>Psionics draw power directly of your conscious mind, so your mind has to be sharp and sound to use them. You can’t use any of your psionic powers if you have some condition that prevents you from thinking clearly such as charmed, frightened, incapacitated, poisoned, or stunned. Also, if you are enduring great physical pain, the GM may rule that you lack the mind to access your psionic abilities. Finally, you must expend an extra Psi Point to use an ability for each level of exhaustion you have.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, physical bounds that normally restrict other casters, such as simple physical paralysis, being restrained or held in a grapple, do not impede a psionic character to use its powers. However, you can’t use effects that require sight if you are blinded.</p>\n<p>The nature of psionics means it is often difficult to ascertain who or what is targeting you. For this reason, no one gains advantage on psionic attacks for being hidden or surprising targets.</p>\n<h2 class=\"arjulian\">Psionics and Rage</h2>\n<p>If you are a Barbarian and enter Rage, you lack the mental acuity to use psionic powers that require concentration and finesse, and you cannot switch your psionic focus. While raging, you can activate abilities from disciplines that do not require concentration so long as they are from the Immortal Order. The physical nature of that order is compatible with the state of mind of a raging individual. Psionic Talents and disciplines from orders outside of the Immortal Order cannot be used while you are raging. However, you can maintain your rage by attacking enemies with psionic abilities within the Immortal Order.</p>\n<h2 class=\"arjulian\">Psi Points</h2>\n<p>You have an internal pool of mental energy that can be used to fuel effects. This energy is represented by Psi Points. Each psionic discipline describes several effects that you can create by spending a certain number of Psi Points on them. A psionic talent does not require any expenditure of Psi Points, and you can use them without any limit besides normal exhaustion.</p>\n<h2 class=\"arjulian\">Psychic Limit</h2>\n<p>Your mind, powerful as it is, isn’t omnipotent…yet. You have a hard limit in which you can warp the reality consensus. This limit is represented by the maximum number of Psi Points you can spend to activate effects of psionic disciplines in a single turn. This limit includes your action, bonus action, and reaction and is based on your character level, as shown in the Psi Limit column of the Progression Chart.</p>\n<p>For example, as a 3rd-level character, you can spend no more than 3 Psi Points on a discipline each time you use it, independently of how many Psi Points you have. If you spend 2 points to use an action, you have 1 point left that you may spend for a bonus action or a reaction later. Budget your points wisely.</p>\n<h2 class=\"arjulian\">Psychic Focus</h2>\n<p>You can focus your subconscious mind into one discipline you know to draw passive benefits from it. These benefits vary from discipline to discipline, and you can only focus on one discipline at a time until you have the Psionic Mastery feature. Your psychic focus ends when you are <em>incapacitated, frightened, charmed</em> or<em> stunned</em>, when you change your focus to another, or when you elect to do so. Some features or abilities may require for your focus to be relinquished in order to activate them.</p>\n<p>You choose your psychic focus when you finish a long rest and may shift it later as an action. You can only shift your focus once per short rest, to a maximum of three shifts each day.</p>\n<h2 class=\"arjulian\">Psionic Mastery</h2>\n<p>At 11th level, your mastery over your psionic energy allows you to push your mind beyond its normal limits. Choose a discipline you know. All the benefits of its psychic focus are permanent to you and do not count against your psychic focus limit. This enables you to choose another discipline you know to have as your psychic focus and still gain its benefits. </p>\n<p>You also gain that discipline’s Mastery effects, described in each discipline. You must be able to afford the Psi Point cost if there is one. However, if you haven’t spent Psi Points in a turn, you can bypass your Psi Limit to use a Mastery Power. As normal, a Mastery focus still ends when you are incapacitated, frightened, charmed or stunned.</p>\n<p>You gain a second Mastery when you reach the 20th level. When you reach 17th level, you gain the Mastery Improvement feature which removes the Concentration tag on any effects of your Mastery discipline, if applicable.</p>\n<h2 class=\"arjulian\">Psionic Disciplines and Talents</h2>\n<p>Psionic talents and disciplines are the heart of a mystic’s craft. They are the mental exercises and psionic formulae used to forge will into tangible effects.</p>\n<p>Psionic disciplines were each discovered by different orders and tend to reflect their creators’ specialties. You can learn any discipline regardless of its associated order although you will benefit from using disciplines from orders that align with your base class and its primary ability score.</p>\n<p>Psionics draw power directly of your conscious mind, so your mind has to be sharp and sound to use them. You can’t use any of your psionic disciplines or talents if you have some condition that alters your mind such as <em>charmed, frightened, incapacitated, poisoned</em> or<em> stunned</em>. Being under mental stress, such as with a temporary madness, can also weirdly interact with your psionics, provoking strange effects, and for each Exhaustion level you have, your Talent’s Psi Points cost increases by 1.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://pergasha.dreadful-odysseys.com/content/psionics.html\">Psionics</a> for a detailled list of Disciplines and Talents.</p>\n<h2 class=\"arjulian\">Using a Discipline</h2>\n<p>Each psionic discipline has several ways you can use it and all contained in its description. The discipline specifies the type of action and number of psi points it requires. It also details whether you must concentrate on its effects, how many targets it affects, what saving throws it requires, and so on.</p>\n<p>The following sections go into more detail on using a discipline.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3 class=\"arjulian\"><strong>Psychic Focus</strong></h3>\n<p>The Psychic Focus section of a discipline describes the benefit you gain when you choose that discipline for your psychic focus. You can only have one focus active at a time, but a focus does not require concentration as other discipline effects may.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3 class=\"arjulian\"><strong>Power Options and Psi Points</strong></h3>\n<p>A discipline provides different powers to activate with your Psi Points. Each power has a name, and the Psi Point cost of that option appears in parentheses after its name. You must spend that number of Psi Points to use that option while abiding by your psi limit. If you don’t have enough Psi Points left, or the cost is above your Psi limit, you can’t use the option.</p>\n<p>Some options show a range of Psi Points rather than a specific cost. To use that option, you must spend a number of points within that range while still abiding by your Psi limit. Some options let you spend additional Psi Points to increase an effect’s potency. Again, you must abide by your Psi limit, and you must spend all the points when you first use the discipline; you can’t decide to spend additional points once you see the discipline in action.</p>\n<p>Each option notes specific information about its effect, including any action required to use it and its range.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3 class=\"arjulian\"><strong>Components</strong></h3>\n<p>Disciplines don’t require the components that many spells require. Using a discipline requires no spoken words, gestures, or materials. The power of psionics comes from the mind.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3 class=\"arjulian\"><strong>Duration</strong></h3>\n<p>An effect option in a discipline specifies how long its effect lasts.</p>\n<p><strong>Instantaneous. </strong>If no duration is specified, the effect of the option is instantaneous.</p>\n<p><strong>Concentration. </strong>Some options require concentration to maintain their effects. This requirement is noted with “conc.” after the option’s psi point cost. The “conc.” notation is followed by the maximum duration of the concentration. For example, if an option says “conc., 1 min.,” you can concentrate on its effect for up to 1 minute. Concentrating on a discipline follows the same rules as concentrating on a spell. This rule means you can’t concentrate on two disciplines at the same time. (See chapter 10, “Spellcasting,” in the <em>Player’s Handbook</em> for how concentration works.)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3 class=\"arjulian\"><strong>Targets and Areas of Effect</strong></h3>\n<p>Psionic disciplines use the same rules as spells for determining targets and areas of effect, as presented in chapter 10, “Spellcasting,” of the <em>Player’s Handbook</em>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3 class=\"arjulian\"><strong>Saving Throws and Attack Rolls</strong></h3>\n<p>If a discipline requires a saving throw, it specifies the type of save and the results of a successful or failed saving throw. The DC for any ability is 8 + your proficiency modifier + the modifier to the applicable ability score.</p>\n<p>Some disciplines require you to make an attack roll to determine whether the discipline’s effect hits its target. The attack roll uses the ability determined by the discipline’s order. The discipline’s category determines which ability score is applicable. When more than one ability score is listed, you select which score you will use.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Avatar: </strong>Charisma or Intelligence</li>\n<li><strong>Awakened: </strong>Intelligence</li>\n<li><strong>Far Hand: </strong>Dexterity or Intelligence</li>\n<li><strong>Immortal: </strong>Strength or Constitution</li>\n<li><strong>Nomad: </strong>Intelligence or Wisdom</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h3 class=\"arjulian\"> </h3>\n<h3 class=\"arjulian\"><strong>Combining Psionic Effects</strong></h3>\n<p>The effects of different psionic disciplines add together while the durations of the disciplines overlap. Likewise, different options from a psionic discipline combine if they are active at the same time. However, a specific option from a psionic discipline doesn’t combine with itself if the option is used multiple times. Instead, the most potent effect—usually dependent on how many Psi Points were used to create the effect— applies while the durations of the effects overlap.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 class=\"arjulian\">Using a Talent</h2>\n<p>Psionic talents are minor abilities that require psionic aptitude but don’t drain your reservoir of psionic power. Talents are similar to disciplines and use the same rules, but with three important exceptions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can never use your psychic focus on a talent.</li>\n<li>Talents don’t require you to spend Psi Points to use them.</li>\n<li>Talents aren’t linked to Mystic Orders.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>The DC for any talent is 8 + your proficiency modifier + your Intelligence modifier.       </em></p>\n<h2>Burn</h2>\n<p>Another key feature of a psionic talent is the ability to overcharge it, enabling a burst of power unavailable through other means. This feature is called Burn, and each talent has its burn listed at the end of its description.</p>\n<p>A burn uses the same action economy associated with the talent unless specified otherwise. Once you burn a talent, you cannot use that specific talent until you take a full rest. </p>\n<p>In addition,<span style=\"font-weight:bold;color:#ff0000\"> you must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw (DC = 15) or suffer one level of Fatigue.</span> If a specific burn has additional side effects, it will be listed in its description. If a talent lists more than one burn option, you must pick which ability you activate.</p>\n<p>You can burn any talent you have, but each talent can only be burned once before needing to be recharged with a <span style=\"font-weight:bold\">full rest.</span> Also, the <span style=\"color:#ff0000;font-weight:bold\">DC for the Intelligence saving throw to avoid Fatigue increases by 2 for each burn you take after the first.</span><em>   </em></p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DI11opiBN9KroioG":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.WjXI97Dr3MYCAHVb"}}}
