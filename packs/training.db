Your mount shares your initiative. While mounted, you use its movement speed in place of your own, and you can comfortably attack with ranged or melee weapons while mounted and moving. In addition, you gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul class=\"pr-4 pb-4\">\n<li class=\"internal-list\"><strong>Quick Mount. </strong>Mounting or dismounting a creature costs you only 5 feet of movement rather than half your speed.</li>\n<li class=\"internal-list\"><strong>One with the Saddle. </strong>You have advantage on saving throws made to avoid falling off your mount. If you fall off your mount and descend no more than 10 feet, you can land on your feet if you’re not incapacitated. If the fall is greater than 10 feet, you have advantage on any saving throws or skill checks made to avoid falling prone, but you will still take falling damage.</li>\n<li class=\"internal-list\"><strong>Mounted Defender. </strong>You can fend off strikes directed at you, your mount, or other creatures nearby. If you or a creature you can see within 5 feet of you is hit by an attack, you can roll 1d8 as a reaction if you’re wielding a melee weapon or a shield. Roll the die, and add the number rolled to the target's AC against that attack. If the attack still hits, the target has resistance against the attack’s damage.<br />    You can use this ability a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.</li>\n<li class=\"internal-list\"><strong>Mounted Strike. </strong>When you are riding upon a creature capable of movement at a speed 40 feet or faster, you can use the momentum of your mount to deal one powerful strike at a target that is not prone or smaller than you. If the weapon also has reach, the prone condition or size difference doesn’t prevent your mounted strike.<br />    You must command your mount to Dash in a straight line through the position of your target. When you enter reach, you can spend one of your attacks to make a special melee attack. If it hits, the target suffers susceptibility (1d10) to the attack damage.<br />    You can then continue the movement of your mount and you do not provoke an opportunity attack if you leave the reach of your target unless your special melee attack missed.</li>\n</ul>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Training","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"psionics"},"requirements":"Fine quality saddle and a mount","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"DI11opiBN9KroioG":3},"flags":{},"_id":"jt92gA9mIHxWl7C5"}
