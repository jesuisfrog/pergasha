When you make a ranged attack, the channeled archer makes one of the following enhancements to your shot. This enhancement remains until your concentration ends, you end the ability, or you evoke this power again to select a different archer.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Arjuna</h2>\n<p>Arjuna’s laser-focused aura keeps your hand steady and enables a penetrating shot.</p>\n<p><strong>Passive</strong>: Your ranged weapon attacks have the Effective property.</p>\n<p><strong>Ducks in a Row!</strong> You make a penetrating shot that cuts through enemies. As an action, select a target within your weapon’s range and any creature in a 60-foot line behind them is also targeted by this attack. Make one ranged attack roll with your weapon and use it to determine which of the targets are successfully hit. The first target in the line to be hit receives full damage from your attack, and subsequent targets hit receive half the amount in psychic damage.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Simetra</h2>\n<p>Simetra’s cleverness is only outshined by her fury. Her forceful personality enhances your ranged attacks to push back the enemy and keep them down—permanently, as is her preference.</p>\n<p><strong>Passive</strong>: On a successful hit with your ranged weapon, you can push a target 5 feet back. The target must be able to fit in the space and must be Huge or smaller to be affected.</p>\n<p><strong>Pin Them Down!</strong> As an action, select a point on the ground within your weapon’s range. You create a hail of force missiles in a 25-foot diameter, 50-foot-tall cylinder. All creatures in the cylinder must make a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone and take force damage equal to your weapon damage + your Wisdom or Intelligence modifier. Flying creatures immediately fall to the ground prone and taking appropriate falling damage in addition to the attack. On a success, creatures take half the damage.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Locksley</h2>\n<p>This vengeful spirit of justice takes from his enemies to give to his allies. Locksley bestows your shots with the ability to sap your foes of strength so the weak are protected.</p>\n<p><strong>Passive</strong>: On a successful ranged weapon attack, your target must make an Intelligence save or be sapped until the start of your next turn. A sapped creature cannot add its ability modifiers to damage rolls.</p>\n<p><strong>Game Over!</strong> As an action, make a ranged weapon attack and on a hit, you attempt to stun your target. Your target takes the damage appropriate to the attack and must make an Intelligence saving throw or is stunned for 1 minute or until you drop your concentration on this ability. At the end of each of its turns, it can make a Constitution saving throw to shrug off the stun. Once a creature has been stunned by you with this ability, it is immune until you take a long rest.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","activation":{"type":"bonus","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":1,"units":"minute"},"target":{"value":1,"width":null,"units":"","type":"object"},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":"0","per":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":"","amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"other","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[["1d10","force"]],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"psionics"},"psionicOrder":"nomad","psionicDiscipline":"intelligentArrow","psicost":"5","concentration":true,"variableCost":{"baseCost":"1","maxCost":"7","psiSpent":0},"scaling":{"mode":"variableCost","formula":"1d10"}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"jOlISKQzRDNVaxSr":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.y2a3zRxj4amh5JQg"}}}
